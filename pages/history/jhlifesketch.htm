		<P class="MsoNormal">I am the oldest son of Hans Jorgensen and Maren Kierstine 
			Pedersen and was born in Otterup Parish on the Island of Fyen, Denmark, October 
			13, 1823. On account of the rather straitened circumstances of my parents, I 
			was forced when very young to engage in a certain business that made it 
			necessary for me to travel around considerably in the country districts, and 
			when old enough I engaged with my father in hard physical labor.</P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">When about nineteen years of age, I went to Copenhagen where 
			for ten years I was in the employ of a wholesale merchant.
		</P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">On the 10th of May, 1846, I commenced military service in the 
			First Regiment of Artillery, after having previously been notified to prepare 
			for military service. After having finished my school instructions, I served 
			for some time as a gunner and was then sent to the training school. While in 
			the riding school, I met one day with a mishap, when the horse I was riding 
			fell and I got between the animal and the rampart, causing my leg to be badly 
			squeezed and one of my knees was injured, which necessitated my being in the 
			hospital for some time. However, shortly afterwards I had become strong enough 
			to be able to repair to the theater of war, for war had meanwhile broken out 
			between
			<st1:country-region w:st="on">
				<st1:place w:st="on">Denmark</st1:place>
			</st1:country-region>
			and the Duchies. With the battery Bruun I was put on shore at Snoghoj,
			<st1:place w:st="on">Jutland</st1:place>, where I got horse and saddle and was 
			appointed commandant of a cannon. The day following (April 9, 1848), I took 
			part in the battle at Bov, one Danish mile north of Flensborg, where in the 
			Sleswic War the first shot was fired at the enemy. From then on I took part in 
			most of the greater battles of the war and was later decorated with the order 
			of Daneborg for exhibited bravery during the great battle at Dybbol in June, 
			1848. In the spring of 1850, while as a soldier I was quartered at Aasum, in 
			the neighborhood of
			<st1:City w:st="on">
				<st1:place w:st="on">Odense</st1:place>
			</st1:City>, I became acquainted with a young lady by the name of Maren Katrine 
			Christensen, whom I married on April 24, 1853. When the war in the beginning of 
			the year 1851 had concluded, I went with my battery to
			<st1:place w:st="on">
				<st1:City w:st="on">Copenhagen</st1:City>
			</st1:place>, and on March 13th was granted home furlough, after the victorious 
			army had been given many demonstrations of honor for exhibited courage and 
			bravery in battle by both the king and several commanders.
			<o:p></o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">After having made a short visit with my relatives on the
			<st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Island</st1:PlaceType>
			of
			<st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Fyen</st1:PlaceName>, I secured employment in
			<st1:City w:st="on">
				<st1:place w:st="on">Copenhagen</st1:place>
			</st1:City>, where I shortly afterwards made acquaintance with the Latter-day 
			Saints.... I became a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints 
			by baptism August 25, 1851, Elder Chr. Christiansen performing the ordinance, 
			and since my time was not very much occupied by temporal labor, I read and 
			studied extensively the Bible, the Book of Mormon and other Church works, 
			thereby gaining considerable knowledge of the principles of the gospel. I soon 
			experienced a heartfelt longing to preach the gospel and often prayed to the 
			Lord that that privilege might be accorded unto me....
			<o:p></o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">At a general conference that was held in
			<st1:City w:st="on">Copenhagen</st1:City>
			November 15 and 16, 1851, I was ordained a priest, and together with Elder 
			William Andersen was set apart to labor as a missionary on the
			<st1:place w:st="on">
<st1:PlaceType w:st="on">island</st1:PlaceType> of 
<st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Fyen</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>. We immediately set out for our 
			field of labor, and commenced to converse with the people, selling tracts and 
			holding meetings, which were generally well attended by fairly well-attentive 
			listeners. One of the first towns we visited on Fyen was Sulkendrup. As we here 
			entered a certain house, a woman walked up to us exclaiming: "Here come my 
			brethren." She had never seen us before, nor had we informed her who we were. 
			This woman's name was Gjertrud Hansen, and I baptized her shortly afterward 
			(December 5, 1851), she being the first fruit of mine and Elder Andersen's 
			labor on Fyen.
			<o:p></o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">We next visited my parents, who received us with joy, and held 
			several well-attended meetings. My father had dreamt a long, long time before 
			this that I should be a savior to his family, but had never understood the 
			meaning thereof. One evening, after I had addressed a large gathering, my 
			father went into his garden, where he bent his knees and in earnest prayer 
			pleaded with the Lord to give him understanding and discernment as to whether 
			the message which I was proclaiming was from God. When he again entered the 
			house, the sign was given him, which caused his whole body to shake terribly 
			and he felt unworthy to enter the room in which I was sitting. With trembling 
			voice and tear-drenched eyes he now requested me to baptize him, which request 
			was granted that same evening. My mother was baptized on the same occasion and 
			a short time afterwards four of my brothers, together with several other 
			people, were also added to the fold by baptism.
			<o:p></o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">Meanwhile a spirit of persecution began to make itself felt in 
			the neighborhood and the rabble banded themselves together for the purpose of 
			doing us harm. One evening when we, as was our custom, had held a meeting in my 
			father's house, the place was surrounded by a big crowd of drunken men, armed 
			with clubs, who said that a certain priest had promised them money if they 
			would give us a good thrashing. One of the mob with a cudgel in his hand 
			started for me, but I and Elder Andersen succeeded in slipping through the door 
			and escaped through the field. My parents, who remained in the house, now 
			became the objects for derision by the mob; they wrote with chalk on my 
			father's back, and subjected him to a great deal of banter, but otherwise did 
			him no bodily harm. The persecutors thereupon ran out of the house for the 
			purpose of finding me and my companion; we had hidden ourselves in a ditch 
			behind a fence. Here we lay listening to their awful cursings and declarations 
			that they would not return to their homes before they had killed us. We humbly 
			prayed to the Lord that he would strike them with blindness, which literally 
			happened, inasmuch as they did not find us, although they were searching for us 
			until after midnight. When they at last gave up the hunt, we repaired to the 
			house, where we sang songs of praise to the Lord for our delivery, and felt 
			exceedingly happy that we were found worthy to be persecuted in Christ's name.
			<o:p></o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">As we felt a burning desire that all should have the privilege 
			of hearing the testimony, Elder Andersen and I went in opposite directions, he 
			going to the south and I to the north. I called upon many of my relatives and 
			friends, who listened to my testimony with joy, and several of them afterwards 
			became faithful members of the
			<st1:place w:st="on">
<st1:PlaceType w:st="on">kingdom</st1:PlaceType> of 
<st1:PlaceName w:st="on">God</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>....
			<o:p></o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">On the 16th of March I organized the first branch of the 
			Church on the
			<st1:place w:st="on">
<st1:PlaceType w:st="on">island</st1:PlaceType> of 
<st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Fyen</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>, giving it the name of 
			Trostrup-Korup's Branch. I had earlier been set apart as president of the same 
			by President Chr. Larsen..
			<o:p></o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">Because of the many baptisms that were performed, the people 
			were incited to persecute us at several places. On a certain occasion, when I 
			was holding a meeting in Svendborg, a mob thus started some mad pranks, and I 
			had to sneak out through a back door, climb over a wall and then leave the 
			town, running through the fields. I was, however, pursued by several persons 
			who had sworn that they would kill me, but I found at last protection at a 
			house close by, and thereby escaped the intended fate. Late in the night I 
			returned to town and retired to rest in the hall of a certain house, the people 
			of which had gone to bed....
			<o:p></o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">While the work made headway and many were baptized, there were 
			also some who fell away and lost their faith. Even my own father permitted 
			himself to be influenced by evil rumors to such an extent that he on a certain 
			occasion requested to be excommunicated. This naturally caused me great sorrow, 
			but I withdrew to a secluded spot and prayed humbly to the Lord in my father's 
			behalf, which had the desired effect. After having thus three times invoked the 
			Lord's help, my father became a changed man. I found him with a blissful smile 
			on his countenance and a perfect satisfaction in his soul, and he, together 
			with my mother, continued to be faithful to the day of their death. My parents 
			left
			<st1:country-region w:st="on">Denmark</st1:country-region>
			in December 1852, and Father arrived in
			<st1:State w:st="on">
				<st1:place w:st="on">Utah</st1:place>
			</st1:State>
			the following year. Mother died while crossing the
			<st1:place w:st="on">Atlantic</st1:place>. After having transferred my position 
			as presiding elder over Fyen, Langeland and Taasinge, to my brother Neils 
			Hansen, I left
			<st1:country-region w:st="on">Denmark</st1:country-region>
			in company with a large party of emigrants on the 26th of December, 1853, and 
			arrived in
			<st1:place w:st="on">
<st1:City w:st="on">Liverpool</st1:City>, 
<st1:country-region w:st="on">England</st1:country-region></st1:place>, on the following 
			9th of January. Here my wife gave birth to a son on the 16th of January, 1854. 
			After sojourning in
			<st1:country-region w:st="on">England</st1:country-region>
			a couple of weeks, we continued our journey over the Atlantic on the sailing 
			vessel Benjamin Adams, and arrived at
			<st1:City w:st="on">
				<st1:place w:st="on">New Orleans</st1:place>
			</st1:City>
			in the course of seven weeks. My wife was very sick on the journey. The cholera 
			broke out in our camp after our arrival in
			<st1:State w:st="on">
				<st1:place w:st="on">Kansas</st1:place>
			</st1:State>
			and among the great number that died were also my brother Jorgen and several of 
			his children. Immediately thereafter we commenced our long journey across the 
			Plains with ox teams and wagons, during which I officiated as captain of the 
			camp. My brother Peder Hansen became ill and died a few days after we had 
			commenced our travel through the desert; my wife also was again attacked by 
			sickness and died on the 29th of July. After an otherwise successful journey, 
			we arrived in
			<st1:City w:st="on">
				<st1:place w:st="on">Salt Lake City</st1:place>
			</st1:City>
			on the 5th of October, 1854. My father, who resided in the Fifth Ward, came to 
			meet us in
			<st1:place w:st="on">
				<st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Emigration</st1:PlaceName>
				<st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Canyon</st1:PlaceType>
			</st1:place>; to be permitted to again see and speak to him was indeed a joyful 
			occasion. The day after our arrival I attended the general conference in the 
			Tabernacle when I, for the first time, beheld President Brigham Young and 
			several of the Twelve Apostles. Of course, I could not understand what they 
			said, but the sight of them and the spirit by which they were animated made a 
			very deep impression upon me. After having resided with my father for a short 
			while, I rented a small place in the Tenth Ward and bought myself a half city 
			lot in the Second Ward, on which I built a house the following year. Meanwhile, 
			being a widower, I began to consider the desirability to again find a companion 
			in life, who also could take a mother's place for my little son. In 
			contemplating the saying in Deuteronomy, 25th chapter, with regard to the duty 
			of a man to his brother's widow, it seemed to be clear to my understanding that 
			the obligation rested on me to marry my deceased brother's widow; and after 
			having been advised by President Jedediah M. Grant of the correctness of my 
			understanding in the matter, I acted on my intuition and married her.
			<o:p></o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">By assisting people to thresh wheat that fall, I earned enough 
			for my own and family's upkeep, but I had bad luck with ten acres of land in
			<st1:place w:st="on">Cottonwood</st1:place>
			which I later bought, having cultivated it for three years without raising 
			anything on it; I also lost several animals.
			<o:p></o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">In the fall of the year 1855, Miss Caroline Knudsen arrived in
			<st1:State w:st="on">Utah</st1:State>
			as an emigrant from
			<st1:country-region w:st="on">
				<st1:place w:st="on">Denmark</st1:place>
			</st1:country-region>
			and since we were acquainted with each other in our native land she made us a 
			visit. About the same time I had counseled with President Erastus Snow about 
			having my departed wife sealed to me for time and eternity, and he had asked me 
			if I did not also have the intention of having a living wife sealed to me. This 
			was a subject about which I had made no decision; however, the young lady 
			mentioned became influenced with the thought that it would serve to her 
			exaltation to become my wife. She sincerely asked the Lord respecting this 
			thought, and through her brother made me acquainted with her feelings. She 
			expressed the desire that I go and ask the prophet of the Lord, that she might 
			know the will of God in the matter. This I did, having first explained all the 
			circumstances to Brother Erastus Snow, who afterward sought the prophet's 
			answer, which was to the effect that it was in accordance with the mind and 
			will of the Lord that I should marry the young lady, which I did on the 3rd of 
			February, 1856, when the ceremony was performed in a room dedicated for that 
			purpose at the residence of President Young, and on the same occasion my 
			departed wife was also sealed to me for time and all eternity. I was therefore 
			able to raise a family that would be my own, and as I have since been blessed 
			with a numerous posterity, I cannot consider it otherwise than being a reward 
			from the Lord, because I did wed my brother's widow for the express purpose of 
			fulfilling the law and doing my duty to my departed brother, and raising seed 
			unto him.
			<o:p></o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">When in 1856 the crickets destroyed the crops, there was a 
			considerable shortage of food in the Territory, and I and my family had, of 
			course, to share the fate with most of the other people. While I did undertake 
			a journey to the north in an effort to earn means for articles of food, and 
			even tried to sell raiments to secure the most needed things for the sustenance 
			of our lives, yet I was unable, though I worked hard, to earn enough for the 
			purpose, and was therefore forced to go out in the field and dig roots and 
			gather greens, which we ate, as we did not have a bit of bread in the house for 
			many weeks. Although I was rather well fixed economically in
			<st1:place w:st="on">
				<st1:country-region w:st="on">Denmark</st1:country-region>
			</st1:place>, I did not permit myself to be disheartened by our sufferings 
			through this extreme poverty and want. I prayed to the Lord to spare our lives 
			that we might not suffer death from famine, and he heard our supplications, for 
			we were all saved from famine, and when the harvest finally commenced, I and my 
			wife Caroline went out in the fields and gleaned grain, from which Karen made 
			flour by grinding it in a coffee mill. And in this manner were our lives 
			preserved.
			<o:p></o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">I had lived in Salt Lake City more than three years when the 
			so-called Utah War broke out, and when in the winter of 1857-1858 the Nauvoo 
			Legion was equipped and prepared for defense, should by chance the attack be 
			made on our people, I took part in an expedition to Echo Canyon as captain of 
			ten. After my return home, I married, on December 20, 1857, Miss Karen 
			Andersen, who had arrived in the valley with a handcart company the previous 
			fall. Four years later I married Marie Sorensen.
			<o:p></o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">In the spring of 1858, when the Saints, because of the war, 
			abandoned the settlements in the north and traveled south, I, together with 
			several others, was left behind in the city with the purpose in view of setting 
			fire to everything if the troops after their arrival in the Valley were showing 
			a disposition to be unfriendly. In the month of May I started for Spanish Fork, 
			to which city part of my family had already departed ahead of the rest of us. 
			Here I commenced to lay the foundation to my present home, and the following 
			spring I was set apart as president over the Scandinavian Saints residing in 
			Spanish Fork. I thereupon disposed of my property in the City and Mill Creek.
			<o:p></o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">In September, 1862, I made a visit to see my father, brother, 
			and other remaining relatives in the northern part of
			<st1:State w:st="on">
				<st1:place w:st="on">Utah</st1:place>
			</st1:State>....
			<o:p></o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">-Jens Hansen
			<o:p></o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">
			<o:p></o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">After Jens returned to his home in Spanish Fork, he again took 
			hold of his temporal as well as spiritual affairs. The Lord blessed his labors 
			to such an extent that he could surround his family with such luxuries as would 
			in some measure make life tolerably pleasant, and he could leave its twenty 
			members in fairly good circumstances when in the April conference 1865, he and 
			eighteen other Scandinavian brethren were called to perform a mission to his 
			native land. He left
			<st1:City w:st="on">Salt Lake City</st1:City>
			May 23, and, after a successful journey, arrived in
			<st1:place w:st="on">
<st1:City w:st="on">Copenhagen</st1:City>, 
<st1:country-region w:st="on">Denmark</st1:country-region></st1:place>, August 20. He was 
			immediately appointed to labor as traveling elder on the
			<st1:PlaceType w:st="on">island</st1:PlaceType>
			of
			<st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Fyen</st1:PlaceName>, and later in all of the Oerenes 
			(
			<st1:place w:st="on">Islands</st1:place>') Conference. While on this mission he 
			held about five hundred meetings and baptized forty persons. He also beheld the 
			power of the Lord on many different occasions and in many various ways. He left
			<st1:country-region w:st="on">Denmark</st1:country-region>
			on June 13, 1867, to return to his home in
			<st1:State w:st="on">
				<st1:place w:st="on">Utah</st1:place>
			</st1:State>, where he arrived in the month of October the same year.
			<o:p></o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">After his return home he labored continually for several years 
			for the support of his family, and since he was elected to various positions of 
			trust, he executed a number of public works.
			<o:p></o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">In the fall of 1878, he was called for the second time to go 
			back to Scandinavia on a mission, and left his family (which at this time 
			consisted of thirty-six souls) in the city of
			<st1:City w:st="on">
				<st1:place w:st="on">Spanish Fork</st1:place>
			</st1:City>
			on the twentieth of October.
			<o:p></o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">On account of the death of his son James, twenty-one years 
			old, he was honorably released from his mission. He traveled
			<o:p></o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">with a company of emigrating Saints in 1879 and returned to 
			his home in Spanish Fork, where he arrived well and sound on September 25.
			<o:p></o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">Although active and alert in the duties which he was called 
			upon to perform in his home town after returning from his second mission, he 
			was permitted to tarry among his family and friends only about six years, when 
			for the third time he was called to perform a mission to his native land. He 
			left his loved ones about January 1, 1886, arriving in
			<st1:City w:st="on">
				<st1:place w:st="on">Copenhagen</st1:place>
			</st1:City>
			January 26. He labored this time principally in the Aarhus Conference, and 
			after having filled a good mission of two years and six months' duration, was 
			honorably released and sailed from
			<st1:City w:st="on">
				<st1:place w:st="on">Copenhagen</st1:place>
			</st1:City>
			for home May 24, 1888, having now spent nearly ten years on foreign missions.
			<o:p></o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">After his return from his third mission, he again became 
			active in the duties required of him as a member of the Church and as a 
			citizen, which he faithfully performed until he suffered a violent death, which 
			sad happening occurred Monday, June 28, 1897. The accident took place on the 
			Friday previous. He had just returned from the old folks' gathering in
			<st1:City w:st="on">
				<st1:place w:st="on">Salt Lake City</st1:place>
			</st1:City>
			and had gone over to one of his daughters' homes, where he stood watching the 
			men raising a haystack pole. This pole fell and struck him on the head. He was 
			hastily carried to the house, but never regained consciousness. The funeral was 
			held in Spanish Fork meetinghouse July 1, 1897, conducted by Bishop A. Nelson. 
			The house was filled to overflowing and a very large cortege of carriages 
			followed the remains of the old veteran to his last resting place in the

		<P class="MsoNormal">Elder Jens Hansen had the distinction of having married more
