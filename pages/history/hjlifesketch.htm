		<p>One year after the gospel was carried to Denmark, by Erastus Snow, the message 
			of truth came to the ears of James Hansen, who readily understood and accepted 
			it.</p>
		<p>Shortly after, he was called on a local mission and embraced his first 
			opportunity to deliver his glad message to his father, Hans Jorgensen. The 
			latter at the time was a man of about fifty-six years and a butcher by trade. 
			He was a man in the habit of using tobacco, tea, and coffee, and always had his 
			teddy jug on the table at meals and often between. So when the principles and 
			commandments of the new church were explained to him it took some time for him 
			to accept them, for he knew he had much to overcome. But day by day he studied 
			the scriptures, decided and accepted it literally. "For," he said, "If it is 
			worth anything, it is worth everything." He abandoned his old customs, began a 
			new life and never till the day of his death, did he go back to his old habits.</p>
		<p>It was the year, 1851, that he and his good wife, Karen Kistina, were baptized. 
			The year following, on December 10, 1852 they left their native land to join 
			their lot with the Saints in Utah.</p>
		<p>Steamers were not known in those days, so they embarked on a sailing vessel, 
			being on the water over three months.</p>
		<p>The poor accommodations and food were too much for the woman who was in delicate 
			health. She was ill during much of the voyage and died near New Orleans. She 
			was taken to a small island, and buried. The vessel sailed on up the 
			Mississippi river to St. Louis, Missouri arriving there April 1st, 1853.</p>
		<p>Here the company provided themselves with outfits to travel across the plains, 
			under the leadership of John Forsgren.</p>
		<p>After they were ready to start Hans Jorgensen, (my father) with most of the 
			other saints in the company, turned over the remainder of their money to their 
			captain to have it exchanged for American money. Forsgren never returned any of 
			the money, which was a hard blow to the faith of those who placed such 
			confidence in him, as well as a financial loss to them.</p>
		<p>My father later reported the matter to the authorities in Salt Lake City, but it 
			seemed that nothing could be gotten from him.</p>
		<p>H.P. Benson, a man in whom the Scandinavian people had such confidence, told him 
			not to worry over the matter, for he would someday be better off than Forsgren. 
			This proved true for this dishonest man died an apostate pauper.</p>
		<p>As the company journeyed along, father was advised to marry again, but we shall 
			leave him plodding along behind an ox team with all his belongings in a wagon.</p>
		<p>Let us turn our attention to one of a group of girls, who every morning started 
			out ahead of the company with cheerful hearts and vigorous tread. When it 
			neared noon and the girls expected soon to reach their midday camping place, 
			they would gather up sticks and other combustible materials in their aprons. 
			Very often, however, their loads became too heavy before the time for stopping 
			arrived, so they would discard their loads and start gathering again. This was 
			often repeated several times during the day, but they consoled themselves with 
			the thought that the next company might receive the benefit of their labors.</p>
		<p>Dorthea Christensen, our heroine, was born in Odense, Veborrie, Denmark, May 1, 
			1827. Her father's name was Christen Andersen, a carpenter by trade. He was an 
			indulgent father and would often enjoy a romp with his children, when he 
			returned from the absence of a week or more. However, they never took advantage 
			of him for when they quarreled or otherwise acted rude, he would throw his red 
			cap at them. They understood the danger signal and all was quiet.</p>
		<p>Dorthea's usefulness started by her taking care of geese. Geese were staked out 
			and she moved them several times a day. She also often tended sheep. It was at 
			this time she learned to embroider on net cloth which she enjoyed very much, 
			but she was not privileged to do much of this type of work, for hard manual 
			labor was her lot through life.</p>
		<p>I remember when she was old, of seeing some of the work similar to what she did 
			while watching her father's sheep, and it moved her to tears.</p>
		<p>Her mother, Anna Maria Andersen, was left a widow while the children were small. 
			Consequently they had poor chance for education, but were obliged to go out to 
			work as soon as they were able. Mary Ann, the oldest daughter, was hired by a 
			well-to-do farmer by the name of Niels Hansen. She remained there eight years. 
			When she left to get married she had been so faithful that they came for her 
			sister, Dorthea.</p>
		<p>Her annual wages were fixed at $10 in cash, two pairs of wooden shoes, five 
			pounds of wool with which to make clothes and stockings, and two suits of 
			underwear made from homespun flax.</p>
		<p>Perhaps it would be interesting to relate what work she was required to do in 
			return. She would rise very early and milk the cows while the housewife got 
			breakfast. Then while the men got their teams ready she would help with the 
			housework and be ready to go with the men into the fields and work until noon. 
			After dinner while the men took their naps she again milked the cows, as was 
			the custom then. Again to the field until evening and then to the cows for 
			their last daily milking. This was the program during harvest time which was 
			followed by the gathering of their fuel from swamps, it was a turf made from 
			certain kinds of coal.</p>
		<p>The evenings were spent carding wool and spinning yarn. After a certain hour 
			Dorthea was allowed to work on her own wool.</p>
		<p>These are some of the things she had to do, and must have been very faithful for 
			she was much liked by all the family, especially one of the boys, Hans 
			Christian, for they became lovers. Later they were engaged and were to have 
			been married when something unexpected happened.</p>
		<p>Dorthea accepted an invitation to attend a meeting of the Latter-day Saints, and 
			enjoyed it very much. She went again a number of times and was converted to the 
			Gospel. Her sweetheart was much opposed to this and tried hard to persuade her 
			to give up the faith, but all in vain. His father also tried to tempt her by 
			promising that if she would stay and marry his son, they would be given the 
			farm. But she was convinced that the message was from God and was baptized 
			November 5, 1852. She and her mother and two sisters started for America one 
			month later, December 10, 1852.</p>
		<p>Having saved enough money to pay her transportation on the water, Dorthea 
			succeeded in getting her belongings hauled across the plains, for sending Niels 
			Christiansen's wife, with her children. (This family later settled in Ephraim)</p>
		<p>It was while journeying toward Utah that my father and mother met, and were 
			married July 4<sup>th</sup>, l853, by a camp fire at Council Bluffs.</p>
		<p>They resumed their journey, reaching Salt Lake City, October 1, 1853. Here they 
			fashioned a dugout to live in, in the Fifth Ward.</p>
		<p>Father assisted in digging the first foundation of the Temple in Salt Lake City.</p>
		<p>Mother went out doing washings and anything else she could to help along. Their 
			first two sons were born here and here also they suffered with the Saints 
			through the grasshopper invasion and subsequent famine, living on sego roots, 
			with occasionally a little coarse bread. Mother said she thought she would 
			surely starve to death, while in a delicate condition. But she was blessed with 
			a healthy constitution and survived it all.</p>
		<p>At one time she was asked to wash for Heber C. Kimball's family. When she 
			reached the place she found a wagon load of clothes awaiting her. She worked at 
			them for two or three days, and when she had finished them they paid her two 
			dollars. Well, mother went home proud as a peacock and hastened to show her 
			invalid neighbor her prize. The poor lady became so jealous she was sick and 
			had to remain in bed for several days.</p>
		<p>In the fall when her oldest son was just beginning to walk mother used to glean 
			wheat in the fields. She took her boy and her sacks along and in the evening 
			when the sacks were full she found it difficult to get home with her burdens. 
			The little chap refused to take an advancing step. He would either sit down or 
			go back.</p>
		<p>The family lived in Salt Lake about two and a half years, then moved to Brigham 
			City where they lived for nine years,</p>
		<p>It was during this time that the call came for all the Saints to move South 
			because of Johnson's army.</p>
		<p>When they returned to their home and got comfortably located they made 
			preparations to go and receive their endowments. Mother had gotten clothes 
			ready but in looking them over she found some little article missing. She 
			decided to call on a neighbor and help her, leaving the clothes on the table, 
			the children all asleep. She had been away a very short time when the alarm 
			"Fire" was heard.</p>
		<p>The cloth window blind had come in contact with a lighted candle and the straw 
			roofed house was in flames. By working quickly they saved the children, unhurt 
			but the trip to the city had to be postponed until a later date.</p>
		<p>The family moved to Logan, April 18th 1865, it being five years after the town 
			was first settled, Here they made a permanent home, which they owned until they 
			died.</p>
		<p>Father and the older boys helped to make the Upper Canal known as the "Logan and 
			Richmond Canal" There were no scrappers in those days and all the excavating 
			had to be done with picks and shovels.</p>
		<p>The boys also assisted in building the first railroad from Ogden to Cache 
			County. I remember as though it were yesterday, the first whistle of a "Puffing 
			Billie" as that engine was called.</p>
		<p>My parents having five sons, thought it well to secure some land for them. 
			Accordingly they got two loads of rough lumber, with which to build a shanty. 
			They crossed David Reese's Ferry and would have settled near his ranch, but 
			were told that Reeses had received a right of way of some kind to claim the 
			range for several miles around for grazing. So they moved farther north and 
			east, unhitched their teams and camped for the night. Father knelt down and 
			blessed the land for the good of his family and their children after them. The 
			Lord heard his prayer, for in the exact spot, where he knelt, a sugar factory 
			now stands, and many of his grandchildren are located in comfortable homes on 
			the land that was claimed by father and his sons.</p>
		<p>Yes, the desert was made to blossom like the rose, but many difficulties had to 
			be overcome.</p>
		<p>First there were numerous bears that made their home in the dry brush along the 
			river bank. At night we would hear them growl and bark, wolves howl, foxes 
			yelp, until a chorus of sounds fell on our ears as we lay in our little one 
			room shanty trying to sleep.</p>
		<p>One evening my brother Jacob stayed away fishing later than he should, so mother 
			rushed him off after the cows, eating a bowl of mush as he went. He sent his 
			faithful dog into the brush and it brought out the cows all right, but with 
			them were a mother bear and her four cubs. As he turned home the bears followed 
			him. When he ran, she ran, and as he slowed his pace she would. However, when 
			he reached home she was close behind him. Mother had heard that bears were 
			afraid of fire and smoke, so she gathered up all the rubbish she could find and 
			kept a smudge most of the night.</p>
		<p>Two other families moved out into the prairie land the same spring, and were our 
			neighbors. But before many years lapsed they gave up their claims and we were 
			alone again.</p>
		<p>Although mother received a very meager education she had learned the Bible from 
			Genesis to Revelation and many of our Sunday hours and evenings passed 
			pleasantly away listening to her interesting Bible stories.</p>
		<p>As we children grew older my father and older brothers stayed in town to take 
			care of the farm and work. The boys often freighted to Montana. Oh, how eagerly 
			we watched the Western road on Saturday afternoons, for father often used to 
			come and spend Sundays with us. He always brought something nice for us. He was 
			a good gardener and brought us fresh vegetables and fruit, such as was 
			obtainable.</p>
		<p>As the country around became more settled the bears and other wild beasts were 
			driven to the mountains and were seldom seen in the valley.</p>
		<p>One morning mother found that the sheep had been frightened and some had escaped 
			from the corral. She was very troubled by this, being alone with the younger 
			children at the time. The following night, however, she and the eldest girl 
			made their beds on a low shed to watch for the intruders. About midnight they 
			were awakened by the sheep bouncing against the willow fence. On looking they 
			say a large beast resting on his forepaws upon the fence, but it was too dark 
			to discover what it was. My sister had a gun and would have fired it at the 
			beast, but mother decided it was not safe to make war on it, thinking, perhaps 
			it was a bear. They began shouting, which caused the bear to go off leisurely. 
			He soon returned to the fence again, but their continued clapping and shouting 
			frightened him back to the river. He crossed it and started through the woods 
			toward Smithfield. The next day a large grizzly bear was shot at that town, 
			which evidently was the same one.</p>
		<p>Later the boys started to dry-farm, as there was no water available on the 
			ranch. However, they were not satisfied with that and tried to get water on 
			their land by means of an engine pump, but failed not to bring water upon the 
			hill, but it proved too expensive for irrigation Later they assisted a project 
			to take a canal out of Bear River, my oldest brother playing an important part 
			in this undertaking and made contracts for much of the work.</p>
		<p>Father died March 19, 1878, being 82 years old. A neighbor placed on his casket 
			a wreath of flowers with a verse in the center written by Eliza R. Snow, as 
			follows: "T'is good to die as he had died, He smiled amid death's conquering 
			gloom, while angels waited by his side, To bear a kindred spirit home."</p>
		<p>Let us draw back the curtain and take a peep at our first Logan home, about this 
			time of year, when the family is moved back from their summer home, and when 
			things are in readiness for King Winter to reign.</p>
		<p>We shall first see the animals comfortably located, along the north side of the 
			yard several low buildings were joined together, covered with straw for pigs, 
			sheep, cows and horses, Then across each end was a long shed provided for the 
			loose cattle. In the lot could be seen a potato and other vegetable pits. Our 
			house was a three-room log house. The room to the north was used for a granary, 
			and by the way it was never known to be empty while father lived.</p>
		<p>The middle room was used for the boys bedroom, but at this time of year, we 
			shall see other things here of much importance to the family.</p>
		<p>One, a bin full of flour, and some bags of dried apples and peaches also a bag 
			of herbs for medicine. On a trunk, in one corner will be seen two or three 
			rolls of home-woven cloth; one linsey of different home dyed colors for the 
			girls dresses, One roll of jeans for the boys suits, Perhaps some cloth has 
			been taken from both rolls or perhaps we are waiting for the tailor, who has 
			promised to come in time to get the boys fixed up for Christmas.</p>
		<p>From this room there is a door to the west, leading to the street, where in 
			summer, marigolds, morning glories, four o'clocks, amber, etc. bind both sides 
			of the path. One door to the east leading to the yard, and to the cellar, which 
			was built against the east side of the house. In the cellar we shall find 
			shelves on both sides, the top ones usually laden with cheese, suspended from 
			the ceiling by wires, so as to keep the mice away. The supply of cheese has 
			been brought from the ranch and will be used and sold during the winter. The 
			lower shelves are used for milk, though now not so plentiful, as in those days 
			we expected our cows to be dry three or four months of the year, There is also 
			a barrelful of meat and some sausages, some of which are cured and kept in bags 
			and buried in the wheat for summer, On the bottom shelf are some jars of peach 
			preserves, etc, and a keg of homemade molasses, On another shelf are several 
			pans of lard turned upside clown on the shelf and a bucket of tallow used to 
			grease the boys high boots, and for wagon dope. Several bunches of candles are 
			hanging from the roof. These have been made by dipping the wicks into warm 
			tallow, letting cool, then repeating the process until large enough,</p>
		<p>The south room to the house is kitchen, living room and bedroom, It was first 
			provided with a fireplace, afterwards replaced by the Franklin stove. A table, 
			three or four chairs, a trunk and a bed; also a trundle bed, were the main 
			furniture.</p>
		<p>It was my privilege to occupy the trundle bed and many times have I awakened 
			before daylight and mother's knitting needles would be going click, click in 
			the dark. She always provided us with good warm stockings in winter although we 
			often went bare-footed in summer.</p>
		<p>Mother lived to see all her children married, and at the time of her death, 
			October 3, 1992 she was the mother of eight children and twenty-five 
			grandchildren. The children named in order are: Jacob, Isaac, Abraham, Anna 
			Maria, Mary Kistina (note spelling: Marion Christena), Hansine Rebecca, Joseph 
			Christian and Moses Peter.</p>
		<p>Her funeral services were held in the Logan Tabernacle and many beautiful floral 
			gifts covered her casket. Many words of praise were uttered by the speakers for 
			her faithfulness and work accomplished and the Good example left her children.</p>
