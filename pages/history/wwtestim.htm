<p>I bear testimony that Joseph Smith was the author of the
endowments as received by the Latter-day Saints. I recevied my
own endowments under his hands and direction and I know they are
true principles. I not only received my own endowments under his
hands, but I bear my testimony that Brigham Young, Heber C.
Kimball, Willard Richards, George A. Smith, John Taylor, and
other brethren received their endowments under the hands and
direction of the Prophet Joseph, and also my wife Phoebe,
Bathsheba Smith, Leonora Taylor, Mary Smith and others whose
names I cannot recall now. The Prophet Joseph laid down his life
for the word of God and testimony of Jesus Christ, and he will be
crowned as a martyr in the presence of God and the Lamb. In all
his testimony to us, the power of God was visibly manifest in the
Prophet Joseph. This is my testimony, spoken by myself into a
talking machine on this the 19th day of March, 1897, in the
ninety-first year of my age. Wilford Woodruff. </p>
