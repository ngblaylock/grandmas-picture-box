<p class="Kick">On June 21, 1895, Seymour B. Young called on
President Wilford Woodruff. That night, writing in his own
journal, Brother Young wrote: &#147;Had a nice visit with him. He
showed to me two of the first volumes of his journal. I never saw
anything kept so nice.&#148;</p>

<p>Anyone who has ever seen any part of Wilford Woodruff&#146;s
journal would certainly agree. It is one of the monumental
examples of personal record-keeping. From the time he joined the
Church in 1833 and through his long, eventful life, Wilford
Woodruff must have spent an hour a day on it, even more when the
occasion required, carefully setting down his experiences and
feelings. Since he lived through exciting times and was often
close to the centers of activity, his ardent consistency in
writing produced one of the magnificent primary sources for the
history of the Church during the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>Wilford Woodruff was not the only Latter-day Saint to keep a
diary. There are hundreds of surviving personal records from the
Saints of the past century. To some extent the practice continues
to the present. Mormon historians used to say that keeping
personal journals or diaries was a thing of the past, but many
people have corrected that, telling of their own diaries or those
of friends or family members, and it seems clear that the
practice is continuing. It should. Probably no people, with the
possible exception of the Puritans or the early Quakers, have
been so mindful of personal records as have the Latter-day Saints.</p>

<p>How do we explain our zeal for writing personal journals? It
doubtless was stimulated by the sense of being involved in events
of historic, even cosmic, significance. Moreover, the strong
sense of family encouraged by our theology must have provided an
additional stimulus; many of the records clearly express the hope
that they will be of value to the author&#146;s children and
grandchildren. But such predisposing influences may have been
less important than the fact that the Saints were advised that it
was their duty to keep a journal.</p>

<p>The advice came originally from the Prophet Joseph Smith and
was repeated by other leaders for many years. As late as the 1890s,
for example, Erastus Snow so advised the Saints in Arizona during
one of his sermons. One of his listeners, Lucy Hannah White
Flake, promptly began to follow his course; during the remaining
years of her life she produced a moving, human record of life on
the Arizona frontier.</p>

<p>Several hundred personal diaries of Latter-day Saints have
been deposited in the Church archives or in other research
libraries. Some are short; others are long. Some are halting and
grammatically unorthodox, others are highly literate. Some are
limited to missionary experiences. Some are by General
Authorities, mission presidents, stake presidents, and bishops,
but many are by ordinary members of the Church. Some are exciting
in their description of conflict and dramatic events; others
reflect lives of drudgery and of eking out a living in a harsh
environment. All these diaries contribute, as no other records
can, to our understanding of what life was like in the past,
helping us to appreciate the achievements of our ancestors.</p>

<p>It is largely through their diaries, for example, that we are
able to appreciate the conversion experiences that brought our
forebears into the Church. On the night of December 29, 1833,
Wilford Woodruff had just attended a cottage meeting and heard
Zerah Pulsipher proclaim the truth of Mormonism. Brother Woodruff
wrote:</p>

<p>&#147;I felt the spirit of God to bear witness that he was the
servant of God. He then commenced preaching and that too as with
authority and when he had finished his discourse I truly felt
that it was the first gospel sermon that I had ever heard &#133;
I could not feel it my duty to leave the house without bearing
witness to the truth before the people. I opened my eyes to see,
my ears to hear, my heart to understand and my doors to entertain
him who had administered unto us.&#148;</p>

<p>Hundreds of other diaries describe their authors&#146;
conversions, a momentous turning point in each of their lives.
Many of them tell of hearing the Prophet Joseph Smith and
becoming acquainted with him. In 1837, after hearing the Prophet
give a sermon that lasted about three hours, Wilford Woodruff
wrote:</p>

<p>&#147;That fountain of light, principle and virtue that came
forth out of the heart and mouth of the prophet Joseph whose soul
like Enoch&#146;s swelled wide as eternity&#151;I say such
evidences presented in such a forcible manner ought to drive into
oblivion every particle of unbelief and dubiety from the mind of
the hearers, for such language, sentiment, principles and spirit
cannot flow from darkness. Joseph Smith Jr. is a prophet of God
raised up for the deliverance of Israel as true as my heart now
burns within me while I am penning these lines, which is as true
as truth itself.&#148;</p>

<p>Thanks to Wilford Woodruff&#146;s habit of keeping a regular
journal we can come close to his emotions as he reflected on the
Prophet&#146;s powerful sermon.</p>

<p>There are other fine moments that would be lost except for
diaries. In crossing the plains in 1847, the Pioneer company
stopped for the Sabbath day and heard a sermon by Heber C.
Kimball. Fortunately Norton Jacob went to his wagon and wrote
down what he heard. Here is his entry for that day:</p>

<p>&#147;Tuesday, 1st day of June 1847&#151;A warm, pleasant
morning. All seem to be under the influence of the good Spirit.
Brother Heber was speaking of selfishness; that everyone should
feel as though they could take hold and assist one another just
as quick as they would themselves; that when we would feel an
interest in all our brethren&#146;s welfare we would be filled
with light and life, while selfishness tends to death; it kills
the soul. One who acts for the good of the whole acts like a god,
while he that coils himself up in himself and only strives to
advance his own affairs will sink down to nothing.&#148;</p>

<p>These noble sentiments can still inspire us as they inspired
Norton Jacob on that spring day of 1847.</p>

<p>Nearly thirty years later, Brigham Young was visiting in St.
George when the temple there was nearing completion. A
celebration was held in which the Saints paid their respects to
President Young on his birthday, and later there was a special
meeting for &#147;old folks.&#148; After the meeting President
Young called Charles L. Walker over to him and asked for a copy
of &#147;The Temple Song&#148; that Brother Walker had composed.
In his diary (a rich and colorful document of the period) Brother
Walker told of a precious experience that he would never forget:</p>

<p>&#147;After meeting I went home and got the song and took it
to him. He treated me very kindly and asked me to sit beside him
and take dinner with him. I spent the time very pleasantly and
found him to be very polite, genial, and sociable and I felt
quite at home in chatting over the work on the temple, old times
and other general topics. In bidding him goodbye he took my hand
in both of his and said, &#145;God bless you. Brother Charley,
and God has blessed you, hasn&#146;t He?&#146; It seemed that in
an instant all the blessings I had ever received were before me.
My emotion was too much to answer him, and I chokingly said,
&#145;I have learned to trust in the Lord.&#146; &#148;</p>

<p>Some of the finest diaries were kept by General Authorities,
men who were very busy and who did not seek to enjoy their &#147;golden
years&#148; in peaceful retirement. Wilford Woodruff&#146;s
monumental journal has already been mentioned. Other imposing
diaries were kept by Franklin D. Richards, Amasa Lyman, Brigham
Young, Jr., Orson F. Whitney, Anthon H. Lund, Heber J. Grant, and
John Henry Smith, to mention only a few.</p>

<p>One of the marvelous surviving diaries is that of Abraham H.
Cannon, whose first entries were made in 1879 during his mission
in Germany and extend nearly to his death in 1896. A son of
George Q. Cannon, Abraham H. held responsible Church positions
and was active in community affairs.</p>

<p>He became a member of the First Council of Seventy and later
was a member of the council of the Twelve. In a beautiful hand he
wrote almost every day, demonstrating a fine sense of what was
important.</p>

<p>Opening the work at random, I found the following entry for
July 26, 1888:</p>

<p>&#147;26 July 1888: Very hot day. Most of the day I spent at
the office where we printed a form of the S.S. Music book. John Q.
was down today and I accompanied him to the base ball match
between the Salt Lakes and Nationals which was won by the former
in a nicely played game by a score of 10 to 3. The Nationals made
all their runs in the first innings. The umpire, Best, was very
unfair to both sides, and allowed the players to influence his
decisions. About 7 P.M. I went down to the farm.&#148;</p>

<p>From this single entry we get tantalizing glimpses into the
preparation of a Sunday School book, the friendly relations
between the author and his brother, entertainment and sports in
the 1880s, and the combination of urban and rural existence that
was common at that time.</p>

<p>The Abraham Cannon journals are full of unexpected treasures:
descriptions of small towns visited for stake conferences;
summaries of talks heard and delivered; activities of the Cannon
family; comments on the theater, horse racing, and other
entertainment; business and politics; and summaries of statements
made by different General Authorities. It is a great human
document and a valuable source for a difficult period in the
history of the Church.</p>

<p>Closer to life as it was lived are the diaries of ordinary
members of the Church. Many of them, especially in the past
century, have an epic sweep, dealing as they do with conversion,
emigration to a new land, travel over vast distances,
exploration, and settlement. One of the great diaries, eloquent
in its simplicity, is that of Joseph Beecroft.</p>

<p>At its start he was in England. In 1856 he emigrated to the
United States and started westward with the Martin handcart
company. At Des Moines, Iowa, he left the camp to go into the
city to buy supplies. Somehow he misunderstood the departure time
or was detained longer than expected, because when he returned to
the camp he found that the company had left. So Beecroft and his
wife sought lodging and work in Des Moines where they remained
until 1859. We read of hard times, hard work, church meetings,
conversations, and some entertainment: &#147;Went to Carrots
circus in the evening&#148;; &#147;Spent the evening at home in
reading, fiddling etc.&#148;</p>

<p>After arriving in Salt Lake City in 1859, Beecroft tried his
hand at a variety of jobs: manufacturing, building, butchering. A
skilled printer, he eventually found employment at the Deseret
News printing office. For a number of years his report of
activities in the printing shop provided an unusual perspective,
from below as it were, on the activities of the News.</p>

<p>Beecroft was marvelously human. Imperfect, making mistakes, he
nevertheless endears himself by his honesty and his faltering
efforts to improve. In 1861, after he had been a member of the
Church for several years, he penned the following entry: &#147;I
paid my first Tything to day &#133; a fine roaster out of a brood
of 10, 7 of which we reared. Oh, Lord help me pay my tything
under all our curcumstances.&#148;</p>

<p>He attempted to establish a homestead in Weber County. It was
hard work against enormous obstacles. To add to the family
income, Joseph and his son John would hire out as fiddlers for
dances and parties. Numerous trips between Weber and Salt Lake
are described, as he went back and forth with produce to sell in
the city and to attend meetings there and buy what was necessary.
On one of these trips in 1862 he noted: &#147;Was overtaken by
one hundred troops on their way from Salt Lake City to the plains
to protect the mail line and telegraph wires.&#148; This, of
course, was during the Civil War. In 1864 Beecroft moved to
Southern Utah and continued to describe his life and thoughts,
his work and worries, his travels and meetings year after year
until 1883.</p>

<p>Those who failed to keep a daily record sometimes wrote
recollections later in life, preserving experiences for others to
enjoy that otherwise would have been lost. Here is Aaron Johnson
describing a meeting with Buffalo Bill at Idaho Falls in 1903. He
had been told that the celebrity was in his private tent getting
ready for the show and did not want to be disturbed.</p>

<p>&#147;I sauntered close to the tent, and could plainly see
Bill. He had been shaved, and the barber&#151;his barber&#151;was
combing Bill&#146;s long hair down over his shoulders, while
another man was busy fastening Bill&#146;s leggings and
decorations properly.</p>

<p>&#147;Through the narrow opening in the tent door I watched
the proceedings until the Old Scout was completely made up for
the show. Then this &#145;Hero of the plains&#146; walked out the
back door of his tent. So I hurried around and when close to him
I said, &#145;Mr. Cody.&#146; He faced me, and I continued:
&#145;Mr. Cody, for a long time I&#146;ve wanted to meet and
shake your hand. What about it?&#146; I asked. &#145;Simplest
thing extant,&#146; he said and took me by the hand! He, Buffalo
Bill, took me by the hand&#151;shook it too, and me only a &#145;Deluded
Mormon!&#146;</p>

<p>&#147;I told Bill I was a Mormon, that I had eight stalwart
boys, and that they all admired him and that his history, Life of
Buffalo Bill, held its place on our center table.</p>

<p>&#147;Bill told me that some of his best friends were Mormons
and that our people who reside in Big Horn Basin were &#145;just
fine.&#146;</p>

<p>&#147;Buffalo Bill then presented me with a string of beads,
telling me to hand them to my wife with his best wishes.</p>

<p>&#147;Then the Scout gave me a pass to the reserved section of
the tent, shook my hand, and we parted&#151;of course.</p>

<p>&#147;The show? Well, I&#146;ll arrange with Victor Hugo to
depict the wonders of this &#145;marvelous&#146; show!&#148;</p>

<p>Glimpses into tender relationships often come through the
journal accounts. Here, for example, is an unpretentious, lovely
tribute from Aaron Johnson to his wife Louisa:</p>

<p class="BverseS">&#147;Louisa&#146;s love for flowers cannot be
surpassed!<br>
Her nature is joyful!<br>
Sweetness is in her soul!<br>
At times joy bursts forth like springtime!<br>
Deep love was born with her.<br>
She loved much.<br>
She was always happy while tending her flowers and garden.<br>
She has a way all her own.<br>
Brown was her hair&#151;tinged with gold!<br>
Brown were her eyes.<br>
Bright flashes of wit she had.<br>
And when with her, life was too short. &#133;&#148;</p>

<p>It is not only the dramatic and colorful events that are worth
recording. It is also valuable to know the daily round of
activities, the hard physical labor that occupied most of the
time of our ancestors, the hardships and discouragements.
Besides, there are many incidents of daily life that are easily
forgotten. Those who record them preserve precious moments that
can later be cherished, relived as it were, by members of the
family. Moments of humor, family incidents, sickness, prayer,
conversations, visits&#151;such is the stuff of diaries that
become rich veins of delight and inspiration and information.</p>

<p>Fortunately many of these vivid personal accounts have been
published in whole or in part. Here are a few of those whose
diaries are available in published form: Israel Barlow, John
Bennion, Henry W. Bigler, John Brown, Thomas D. Brown, William
Clayton, Howard Egan, Joseph Fish, Thales Haskell, Norton Jacob,
Andrew Jenson, John D. Lee, Jesse N. Smith, Hosea Stout, Archer
Walters, and John Woodhouse. Many others remain unpublished. The
guide to Mormon diaries that I have been preparing should help
interested readers in finding both published and unpublished
accounts.</p>

<p>If you have such records in your personal possession or if you
know of such material elsewhere, the Historical Department of the
Church would be grateful to hear about them. Many people have
made a wise decision in turning over such handwritten or typed
material to the church archives, where it can be safely preserved
under proper humidity control for future generations. Others have
at least agreed to have the church archives make a photocopy of
the original, thus providing some insurance against loss.</p>

<p>It is often easier even for the descendants to examine
grandfather&#146;s journal in the pleasant atmosphere of the
church archives than to find it in the home of a relative. After
all, if someone took the time and effort to write the account in
the first place, it seems that those into whose hands the work
has fallen should do what is necessary to see that it is
preserved. (Note: in this article all quotations from journals
may be found in the archives division of the Church Historical
Department.)</p>

<p>We cannot all be Wilford Woodruffs, but we can be motivated as
he was to keep a record of our own activities. And we can honor
and protect the records of our fathers. It is through such
records that our historians, present and future, will endeavor to
write a true and faithful history of the Latter-day Saints.</p>
