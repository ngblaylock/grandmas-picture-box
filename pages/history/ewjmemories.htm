		<p><u>Smoke in the Granary</u></p>
		<p>Grandpa: We got down in that old broken tin granary and built a fire.</p>
		<p>Linda: In the granary?</p>
		<p>Grandpa: Yeah, yeah, yes sir. Then, we smoked all those dukes on some sacks . . 
			. tried to put the fire out. There was lots of smoke. By then, I couldn't see. 
			By then, we got great big green flames under that granary. The wind took it. . 
			. . the fire . . . The smoke was so bad; . . . By then I was so sick I didn't 
			care. And that guy, he wasn't very religious, anyway. He said, "can you pray." 
			I said, "I don't know if I can or not," He said, "Be quiet, I will." "We better 
			start praying," he says. "We gotta put that fire out or I'll get a whippen." So 
			I said, "How are we going to do it?" "Throw dirt on it," he said. Well, we had 
			it right in the middle of a rock pile. So we threw the rocks on it. And it 
			didn't put the fire out. So he said, "We'll run down the hill (to get some 
			dirt)." Oh, which pretty near the length of this building (the Elks Hospital). 
			We had to run fast to get it out. . . . It burnt faster. Oh boy!</p>
		<p>Linda: Did you get the fire out?</p>
		<p>Grandpa: No, we didn't. Harvey Simons was over there working his grass line and 
			he looked up and he said, "Hey you guys-put that fire out." . . . And there we 
			sat. "Well, we gotta get this fire out, . . . bags of . . . and here comes 
			Harvey Simons." And I shout, "If Dad's doesn't whip me this time for this 
			misdemeanor I'd never smoke it again," and I didn't. He didn't whip me and I 
			didn't smoke no more of this foolishness.</p>
		<p><u>Moonshine</u></p>
		<p>I went with those boys downtown one night. And they had this moonshine. They got 
			a couple of bottle of it. They wanted me to drink with them. I told them I 
			don't want to drink that garbage. You go ahead and drink it and they did and 
			they got drunk. They were drunk. . . . hung around there they were lazy. There 
			you know-they were truing to sober up so they dared to go home. I finally I 
			took off and went home. And left them.</p>
		<p>Mom said, "Where have you been?" when I came in. I said I went with the boys 
			downtown - mom said what did you do? Well, I knew right then I'd have to tell 
			her. I said, well they had some moonshine . . . I says well, I didn't drink any 
			but the rest of them did and they are pretty souped up. I said, I didn't want 
			to stay around there while they sobered up so I came home. Mom told Carlyn and 
			Berdise and they went down and told all the mothers of those kids that their 
			kids had been on a bender. And the they were going to beat me up for telling on 
			them.
		</p>
		<p>Bryce: If you didn't get it one way you got it another.</p>
		<p>Grandpa: I told them right out, I says, you guy know you are doing wrong so what 
			do you want to beat me up for. You knew better. The kind of cooled down and 
			didn't beat me up. I didn't go fool with them anymore. Because they wanted to 
			drink and go crazy like that they could do it all by themselves. So I got very 
			unpopular.
		</p>
		<p>I didn't like what they were doing to all the girls in the ward anyway. There 
			wasn't a one of them down there they didn't play with or whatever you call it.</p>
		<p>And I said well, I don't want any of them anyway - they are second handed. So I 
			wouldn't go with them and they kept messing with them and finally they went off 
			to Wellsville and found them a wife and left the home kids high and dry - and I 
			didn't think that was good either. I finally moved away and ended up in 
			Riverside and that's where Mom was, so I married her.</p>
		<p><u>1</u><sup><u>st</u></sup><u> Job</u></p>
		<p>First job pitching tater bags. Handle very good. 68 cents an hour. And I thought 
			I was doing good.
		</p>
		<p>Linda: It was in those days.</p>
		<p>Grandpa: Boy, I well we could pay our bills and that's about all. With what we 
			got paid.</p>
		<p>How soon was it after you got married that you we to Arco and broke that land 
			out of Sagebrush.</p>
		<p>
			Grandpa: Well, we went up there the first year we were married and that was 
			1941. Spring of 1941 we went up there and worked with Wilkee Noble that summer 
			and well between Wilkee and me we got grandpa Moses 80 acres planted and for 
			the next year we moved back to Riverside for the winter. Next year we moved up 
			there in that old ram shock of a house. Jesse T came up there with Bings, 
			storming around with little faith that we would get it fixed. So we got one 
			room fixed and moved in. And that was the end of Jesse T. He took off and left 
			me to fix the rest of it. So we plastered and patched the holes in 
			the&nbsp;bedroom, then we had two rooms done and we fixed up another room and 
			we had three rooms. And that was as far as I got. We bought the 40 then so we 
			decided we'd run grandpa Moses place one more year and live there and live 
			there and farm the 40 and I'll be damed if grandpa didn't sell it out from 
			under us. And left us high and dry. No house to live in and no nothing. The 40 
			acres we bought had a one-room.</p>
		<p>We were all in that one room and I told Leone, I said, "we can't go on much 
			longer. We can't live here like this all summer and that was in the spring. I 
			went over to Wilkee and he had a bunch of old beat up cinder blocks. I told him 
			if he would let me use them I would build my house and then in the fall I would 
			replace them when it. .. In the fall when we got that trade done and went down 
			to Boise Payette lumber, only it was in Arco. I knew that guy pretty well and 
			he loaned me about $1,500 worth of credit on lumber and stuff and we built that 
			house on the highway. So between that we had about $5,000 in that shock when we 
			got it done. But it was so warm. Wind and snow blowing in the wintertime inside 
			there you couldn't tell if it was whistling or what. We had that warm mouning 
			stove and we could fill that thing full at night and it would burn all night 
			and half the next day and we never got cold in that building. I had it 
			insulated on top 6 inches.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>THIS IS A PAGE OUT OF ORDER:</p>
		<p>I bought a real killer diller from that sucker old "run away at the drop of a 
			hat." I hooked him up one day and Brownie together and that was a mistake.</p>
		<p>NEW PAGE:</p>
		<p>Its about supposed to be 6 inches of insulation in these . . . about that many . 
			. . we put over them we went up there and put some more on top. We put white 
			pine on the ceiling and we didn't like that so we plastered over the top of it. 
			It was really a pretty warm home with cinder blocks all the way around. It 
			didn't take much to heat that thing. It the best - the really the best home 
			we've ever had except for we built it for a garage.</p>
		<p>I ... one two three four rooms and a bathroom and the kitchen was last the 
			living south bathroom outside door was right there. You walked in that doorway 
			and was in the living or the Kitchen. The kitchen was here and the living room 
			and you could go either way. Most the time we headed for the kitchen cause 
			that's where the food was.</p>
		<p><u>Horses</u></p>
		<p>Bryce: Didn't you have a team of horses when you broke that land down?</p>
		<p>Grandpa: 6 head of horses - Chub and Browny. I can't remember what I called the 
			Chub one, that dirty one.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p><u>Notes</u></p>
		<p>Remember 5 more waffles.</p>
		<p>Dad and Levi and Leon and two girls were going to Bear Lake. We left early to 
			get a good start when we got into town we stopped to get something to eat. We 
			went into a&nbsp;<SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">restaurant 
</SPAN>
			and order some waffles. The were hugh and we. When we got them eaten, Dad 
			ordered 5 more. There were so sick they upchucked on the way to Bear Lake.</p>
		<p>Dad tells the time he dove into the water and it was only a foot deep. He 
			skinned his nose and chest.</p>
		<p>Dad's egg allowance. Dad used to get and egg a week and would take it to the 
			store and trade it in on a big candy bar called Big Daddy. And when the 
			chicken's didn't lay enough we didn't get anything.</p>
		<p>On the fourth of July, we got a nickle and we were told not to spend it all in 
			one place.
		</p>
		<p>We walked everywhere we went. When we went to school we took our lunch for the 
			whole family wrapped in newspaper, tied in a string. When it was lunch time the 
			whole family would gather together to eat lunch.</p>
		<p>Dad went out to get on Happy their family pony. He was going to show aunt Amy 
			how Tom Micks rode his horse. The minute dad hit the saddle, the pony took off 
			straight for the close line, swept him off and left him on his rear.</p>
		<p><u>Mustang Story in Nevada with my Dad</u></p>
		<p>My grandpa and Uncle Merv, Uncle Orin and Dad would go to Nevada to round up 
			wild mustangs and bring them to Hyde Park and green break them and sell them to 
			people in town for work horses. They would sell them in teams for about 500 a 
			team. One by one people started buying tractors and that ended the horse deal.</p>
		<p>My mother would catch me out there peeking in the corrals and would be scared to 
			death. I was just a little kid then.
		</p>
		<p>Hyde Park, Dad and I was sawing the tree down cutting down the poplar tree. 
			Uncle Darrel and Uncle Mervin were holding the rope. They got the tree swaying. 
			When the tree was ready, Uncle Darrell went one way and Uncle Mervin the other 
			and the tree caught Uncle Merv.</p>
		<p>Apple Valley, Lolanne starting the D.C. case. The tractor was new.
		</p>
		<p>Lolanne running the SC tractor over the hill.</p>
		<p>Hyde Park, An incident with the pine hen. I went walked up the ridge all alone 
			to the ridge to poach a pine hen. I got all the way up to the ridge and didn't 
			see a pine hen (there was a skiff of snow). So I turned around and in my tracks 
			I saw the biggest Mountain Lion tracks I ever saw. He jumped off the trail and 
			into the bushes. I got off the Mountain as fast as I could and didn't feel good 
			until I passes through the gate on Cedar Hill. The cat had followed me 400 feet 
			and I didn't know it. I lost all interest in poaching Pine Hens. Pine Hens 
			should stand there and let you shoot them. If you missed they would let you 
			shoot again. I got out in the open away from trees and ran as fast as I could.</p>
		<p>When I went to get my blessing I had a queer sensation I never forgot. I haven't 
			told many people. I went to Harvey Session place in Logan. I rode the pony down 
			and tied her up to a tree. I went in and he set me up on a stool. It was so 
			high I set my feet on a ring. The minute he started that blessing it felt like 
			we were carried away on a high pinicle. It was scary. When it was all over he 
			said "Amen" and I felt like we were in the room again.</p>
		<p><u>Saturday Night Baths</u></p>
		<p>When we were kids we would start with the little one first and then we would add 
			hot water to the tub when it got cold so we wouldn't have to pack the water. 
			The bigger kids would pack their own water so they wouldn't have to bathe in 
			the other kids water.</p>
		<p>We bathed in the kitchen in the galvanized tub next to the stove and put wood in 
			the stove to make it warmer. We each had our own towel. We used regular hand 
			soap to take a bath but mom made home-made soap to wash clothes with.</p>
		<p>Everytime we killed a pig or cow we saved the fat and rendered it out and made 
			soap.</p>
		<p>Kids in the family. I was number six. Levi no. 7. Cleon no. 8. Norma 9. Arland 
			Cle__ died a month after he was born with pnemonia.
		</p>
		<p>Venda 1, Berdice 2, Carlyn 3, Lyda 4, Arda 5, Dad 6, Levi 7, Cleon 8, Norma 9 -
		</p>
		<p>I was born up on the hill in Hyde Park and lived there until I left home and 
			came to Idaho at 24. I worked a winter for Bert Cutforth in Blackfoot, 
			(Riverside</p>
		<p><u>The Elks</u></p>
		<p>I go to bed at 8:00 and don't get up until 6:30. I have real tired hips before 
			the night is over.</p>
		<p><u>Impressions from Bryce - March 1988</u></p>
		<p>As a very young boy my first impressions of my father was that he was a warm and 
			loving person. Dad was always willing to take Rod and I with him everwhere he 
			went. That is why I can remember catching trout in the irrigation ditch with a 
			shovel. I can remember standing on the wagon holding to the reins of our team 
			during thrashing time as Dad would walk along throwing the shucks of grain with 
			his fork. I remember the thrill when the team got the chich chich they would 
			walk forward until Dad would "woa" them down. We really thought we were driving 
			and it was a thrill. When dad bought his first farm, all he would let us stand 
			between his legs and hang on to the steering wheel. During mowing time as the 
			hay fell behind the cutter bar and I would jog along and at times we would 
			stop, bunch the hay up and jump on it. Now, even during winter time, I can 
			still smell the freshly mown hay. I remember ghow great it was to grab his hand 
			when he would throw his shovel over his shoulder go to irrigate. I remember how 
			long his stride was and hoped someday I could stride like he had. One really 
			special memory from thanksgiving and Christmas was that Dad would sing or from 
			Christmas carols or Church hymns. Even at other times you could hear him 
			singing a happy tune. I used to think that's why Dad went to Church, so he 
			could sing to us on the way to and from.</p>
		<p>My father had very little tolerance for disobedience, and although he corrected 
			us many times, he still had the ability to give us warmth and love. One day dad 
			went to caldwell to see the FmhA, while he was done I was suppose to mow hay. I 
			mowed about 5 minutes of that whole afternoon and when Dad arrived home and 
			found not only the mowing undone and also the mower broke down he was furious. 
			He took the pitman stick or what was left and broke it again over my backside. 
			I was very stunned over the whole affair and I can still remember how sorrowful 
			I was about letting my father down by not following through with my job.</p>
		<p>I remember many experiences working on projects with my Dad or uncle Levi. My 
			father always had a project of some sort or other. Leveling land, building on 
			the house, picking spuds or corn, shoveling ditch, building a beet cultavator, 
			and many, many other. Our chance to slip away into idleness was very slim. I 
			can even remember working till two in the morning to repair a clutch or the 
			truck so we would have it back into the corn field the next morning. Later, now 
			that I have boys, I appreciate his ability to always have something for us to 
			do.</p>
