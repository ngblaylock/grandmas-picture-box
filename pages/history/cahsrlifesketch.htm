		<P>Charles Alfred Harper was born January 27, 1817, at Upper Providence, Township 
			Montgomery Co. Pennsylvania</ST1:PLACE></ST1:STATE>. He was the second of three 
			sons; he was the child of Eleanor Evans and Jessie Harper. His people were 
			among the early settlers of
			<st1:country-region w:st="on">
				<st1:place w:st="on">America
			</st1:country-region>. His father and grandfather were born in
			<st1:State w:st="on">
				<st1:place w:st="on">Pennsylvania
			</st1:State>. His mother was a Quaker. When Charles was six years old, his 
			father died.
			<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">Little is known of the boyhood of Charles Alfred. Undoubtedly 
			he was schooled in the stern manner of that period. A granddaughter, Eleanor 
			Peterson Ure, recalls he spoke of graduating from
			<st1:place w:st="on">
				<st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Yale</st1:PlaceName>
				<st1:PlaceType w:st="on">University</st1:PlaceType>
			at 23 years of age, Charles married his first wife, Lavina Wollerton Dilworth 
			December 26, 1839 in
			<st1:State w:st="on">
				<st1:place w:st="on">Pennsylvania
			</st1:State>. Their first children were twins, and were born and died the same 
			day in
			<st1:State w:st="on">
					<st1:place w:st="on">Pennsylvania</st1:place>
				</st1:State>.
			<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">His first wife became a member of the Church of Jesus Christ 
			of Latter-day Saints in the year 1844. Prior to his conversion, he did not like 
			the Mormons and when his wife became one he told her he would not walk down the 
			street with a Mormon. So he walked down one side and she the other. One day 
			Grandfather Harper walked away from home and said he would be back soon. It was 
			not very long before his wife heard him coming home singing, seeming to be very 
			happy and also wringing wet. "Yes, I did it today and I am the happiest man 
			alive." Thus he was baptized.
			<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">During their stay in Nauvoo he was acquainted with the Prophet 
			Joseph Smith and Brigham Young. And his dear friend was Heber C. Kimball.
			<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">He shared in the trouble and exodus of the saints in Nauvoo in 
			the year 1845. Charles [Text missing here] home, and his own shop. He was 
			indispensable during these hectic times. He was busy night and day repairing 
			wagons, etc to equip outfits for emigration to the West. Two more children were 
			born in Nauvoo and of the two, one died and was also buried there, in the early 
			part of 1847. With their small son they joined the Saints at Winter Quarters. 
			Here he was prevailed upon to drive the cannon wagon from the
			<st1:place w:st="on">Platte</st1:place>
			crossing, westward.
			<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">Charles Alfred was in the advanced company who entered the 
			valley July 22, 1847. He was put in charge of a committee to plant the seeds 
			and fix the ploughs. Early in August Charles returned back over that pioneer 
			trail to Winter Quarters to join his wife and son. They had been unable to make 
			the trip. In the spring of 1848 they set out to join the Saints in the

				<st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Laramie</st1:PlaceName>
			</st1:place>
			their emigrant train rested a few days and their second son (fifth child) was 
			born.
			<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">He was one of the first to build in
			<st1:place w:st="on">Holladay</st1:place>
			and was one of the largest land owners there and even at his death he owned the 
			home and thirty six acres of farmland.&nbsp;
			<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">The first pubic school was in Big Cottonwood, and was started 
			by Abraham Hunsaker and Charles A. Harper in the year 1849. Lyman Woods was the 
			first teacher and Charles A Harper, Isaac Harrison and Duncan Casper were 
			elected trustees and held these positions for eight years. Another son was born 
			1851 and lived three years.
			<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">During his first mission to
			<st1:country-region w:st="on">England</st1:country-region>
			he converted a pretty little English girl, Harriet Taylor, she came to
			<st1:country-region w:st="on">America</st1:country-region>
			and crossed the plains in Captain Harper's company, reaching
			<st1:place w:st="on">
				<st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Salt</st1:PlaceName>
				<st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Lake</st1:PlaceType>
				<st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Valley</st1:PlaceType>
			</st1:place>
			in October 1855. On her nineteenth birthday she was married in the Endowment 
			house at
			<st1:City w:st="on">
				<st1:place w:st="on">Salt 
Lake City
			</st1:City>, to Charles Alfred Harper, as his second wife. (He was 39 years of 
			age)
			<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">It is told that upon their arrival in Utah he took his young 
			blue eyed bride to the home of his first wife, and although he had written 
			ahead for her consent for a second marriage, she had a difficult time and it 
			was only after much fasting and praying she had told him that if he insisted, 
			to go ahead. However, upon their arrival his first wife became very angry and 
			made Harriet sleep on the floor. In 1856 his first wife had another son, 
			Alfred, but he lived only 3 months.
			<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">For the next few years he made several trips across the plains 
			as a Captain of a company, assisting emigrants to reach
			<st1:City w:st="on">
				<st1:place w:st="on">Salt Lake City</st1:place>
			</st1:City>
			(At times with his own money). Most of these trips were made by ox-team. He was 
			always known to be just and careful, never urging his company on to make time 
			records. During one of these trips, some Indians rode up and stopped alongside 
			grandfather's wagon and demanded food. The company was sorely in need of food 
			themselves with none to spare. The Indian Chief threw his buffalo robe upon the 
			ground in front of the oxen and gave the sign meaning, "We will not allow you 
			to drive on until we get what we want." Grandfather picked up the chiefs robe, 
			threw it to one side and called, "Drive on." The Indians turned and rode on 
			their way. Many expressed fear of an attack from the Indians, as a result of 
			disobedience, but the company resumed their journey unharmed. This is an 
			Illustration of grandfather's bravery, integrity and determination.
			<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">He was a faithful Latter-day Saint, serving two missions to
			<st1:country-region w:st="on">
				<st1:place w:st="on">England</st1:place>
			</st1:country-region>
			for the Church. In 1856 he was requested by the Church to settle
			<st1:place w:st="on">
<st1:City w:st="on">Carson</st1:City>, 
<st1:State w:st="on">Nevada</st1:State></st1:place>. And with his young wife Harriet, they 
			moved there. Their first baby, named Harriet, was born there. They had some 
			most sever experiences and privations. The food supply was very meager. Finally 
			the Church recalled this mission as being a failure and they returned to their 
			home. His second wife gave him two more daughters, Elizabeth and Emmaline.
			<st1:City w:st="on">
				<st1:place w:st="on">Elizabeth</st1:place>
			</st1:City>
			fell into an open fireplace while very small and died of burns. His first wife 
			had two more sons and another set of twins.
			<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">About 1860 he and his second wife obtained property in 
			Parley's Park, Summit Co.
			<st1:State w:st="on">
				<st1:place w:st="on">Utah</st1:place>
			</st1:State>. They lived there for eighteen years, and were engaged in the 
			sheep and cattle industry, and prospered. Two girls and three boys were born 
			while here. He was called upon by Brigham Young to help establish places in 
			Southern Utah and
			<st1:State w:st="on">
				<st1:place w:st="on">Arizona</st1:place>
			</st1:State>.
			<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">In 1887 Grandfather Harper purchased a farm of forty acres in
			<st1:place w:st="on">
<st1:City w:st="on">Lehi</st1:City>, 
<st1:State w:st="on">Arizona</st1:State></st1:place>. It was raw and covered with mesquite. 
			At nearly seventy years of age he grubbed this off and built a brick home where 
			he and his first wife lived for about 8 years before they returned to their 
			home in
			<st1:place w:st="on">Holladay</st1:place>.
			<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">Captain Harper was a man of striking personality and 
			leadership. He was also a faithful Latter-day Saint; he held various 
			responsible positions in the Holladay Ward. He was a lover of music and 
			literature and loved to take part in the old dances and good times. His 
			favorite dance was the Virginia Reel, and his favorite tune, "Leather 
			Breeches." He was interested in community and political affairs and was a 
			staunch Democrat.
			<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">The following is an extract from the "Salt Lake Tribune." 
			"Charles A. Harper, a pioneer of '47, was found dead in his home at Holladay,
			<st1:place w:st="on">
				<st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Salt</st1:PlaceName>
				<st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Lake</st1:PlaceType>
				<st1:PlaceType w:st="on">County</st1:PlaceType>
			</st1:place>, yesterday. The discovery was made by Mrs. George [Text missing] 
			daughter-in-law, who publicly notified other members of the family. It appears 
			that this gentleman, who was eighty-three years of age, had sought the quiet of 
			his own room and fallen asleep never to awaken again in this life. He had not 
			been ill nor was his death expected, though he was getting quite feeble. His 
			death was due to heart failure, as determined by an inquest conducted by 
			Justice Stevenson."
			<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">Eighty-three years crowned with the glory of pioneering from 
			start to finish was a most beautiful close to a beautiful life well lived. 
			Fifty years of pioneering had fulfilled the promise of the Lord; the desert was 
			blooming like a rose. And to those years go the crowning glory of his life. He 
			had eleven children with his first wife and eight with the second wife. Of the 
			total of nineteen, eight died in infancy. Eleven survived their parents.

		<P class="MsoNormal">The most interesting pioneer visitor at the Jubilee 
			headquarters in
			<st1:City w:st="on">Salt Lake City</st1:City>
			this week was Charles Alfred Harper, age 81, of Holladay,
			<st1:place w:st="on">
				<st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Cottonwood</st1:PlaceName>
				<st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Canyon
			</st1:place>, who is hale and hearty for an octogenarian. He was one of the men 
			of whom Orson Pratt was the leader, who were sent ahead by Brigham Young to 
			plant seed arrived in the
			<st1:place w:st="on">
				<st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Salt</st1:PlaceName>
				<st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Lake</st1:PlaceType>
			</st1:place>
			valley through Emigration canyon on July 22, 1847, and two days in advance of 
			Brigham Young. He says Orson Pratt and Porter Rockwell were the first of the 
			pioneers to explore the valley in the vicinity of the site of
			<st1:City w:st="on">
				<st1:place w:st="on">Salt lake 
City</st1:place>
			</st1:City>
			and that was after known as the Eighth ward square. The first seeds planted 
			were potatoes, also onions, cucumbers, and beans. A plot of ground near Red 
			Butte hollow was subsequently selected for gardening purposes, but neither 
			effort resulted in what could be termed success.
			<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">Mr. Harper was one of the party of ten hunters who procured 
			buffalo meat for the pioneer company suffering for the want of nourishing food 
			while journeying across the plains, and he relates with great unction the 
			gastronomical feats he and his companions performed with the meat of the 
			Buffaloes they had killed. He also states that the pioneers established their 
			second camp August 2, 1847 on the block in which the tithing yard is now 
			located, and not on the
			<st1:Street w:st="on">
				<st1:address w:st="on">Temple 
Square</st1:address>
			</st1:Street>, as some claim.
			<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">He tells of being in awe of the high cliffs and mountain walls 
			as they came through immigration canyon and the dense brush and undergrowth in 
			immigration canyon and how impossible it was for the wagons to move forward 
			until the growth was cut away, and how some pioneers hauled their wagons by 
			hand around a spur of mountains to avoid the undergrowth obstruction.
			<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">He was a humble, obedient, giving; hard working man. He was 
			alive and well when the monument in down town SLC was put in place. His name is 
			on the
			<st1:PlaceType w:st="on">monument</st1:PlaceType>
			of
			<st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Brigham Young</st1:PlaceName>
			in downtown
			<st1:City w:st="on">Salt 
Lake City</st1:City>
			and also at "This is the
			<st1:place w:st="on">
				<st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Place</st1:PlaceName>
				<st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Monument</st1:PlaceType>
			</st1:place>" at the mouth of Emigration canyon. His personal journal was 
			placed in the Historians office in S.L.C in 1971-a small 3 X 5 worn, pocket 
			record bound in fine brown leather-it contains the journey record of the first 
			migration, of settlers to S.L. valley. Although a personal friend of Brigham 
			Young and Heber C. Kimball he never sought high positions and often said, "he 
			felt bigger on the back seat."</P>
