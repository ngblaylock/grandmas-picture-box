<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify">Charles Harper had learned the
trade of wheelwright and carriage maker and was considered an almost
indispensable man to the leaders of the Church on this westward trek in 1847,
and to the persecuted Saints in Nauvoo previous to their expulsion from that
city and later in Winter Quarters. Wagons for the migration were hard to obtain
and many had to be made without delay, so Charles was kept busy at this
important trade almost day and night.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify">When the company neared the
crossing of the Platte River President Young prevailed upon Charles to drive
"the canyon wagon" outfit. Along the route Charles filled a definite
need with his knowledge of the wheelwright trade. He was placed in the advanced
company and entered the Valley July 22nd.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN:justify">Early in August, Mr. Harper
returned to Winter Quarters to join his wife and family. With the arrival of
Spring, 1848, he set out with them to rejoin the Saints in Salt Lake Valley. At

, July 23, 1848, the emigrant train rested a few days. In the covered wagon of
Charles Alfred and Laving Wollerton Dilworth Harper the birth of their second
son and fifth child took place. One little daughter had been buried in Nauvoo.</p>

in starting the first public school in that area. Harriet Taylor became his
second wife in 1855. The following was taken from a newspaper clipping (1897):<o:p>

at the Tribune office, and though in his eightieth year, is hale and hearty. Mr.
Harper remembered many of the details of the great trip perfectly, and is an
entertaining man in his recital of incidents of the journey. He was born in <st1:place w:st="on">

, January 27, 1817. By his trade he was a carriage maker and in this work was a
handy member of the pioneer band, remaining in Nauvoo until the very last to
assist the Saints to outfit themselves for the trek . . . Mr. Harper said that
Salt Lake Valley at that time was a most desolate country with only a patch of
green here and there along the banks of the creek, and the prospect was not
inviting."</p>

Charles Harper did considerable missionary work at home and abroad. He was a
lover of music and dancing, his favorite dance being the Virginia Reel and his
best loved tune "Leather Breeches." He was found dead in his home in <st1:place w:st="on">
Holladay</st1:place>
 April 24, 1900, apparently from a heart attack.</p>
