		<p>12 May 1850 - Birth, Salt Lake City, to Elizabeth Taylor Boyes and George Boyes, 
			who farmed for a living in Big Cottonwood. She was the second child of 
			Elizabeth and George. Their first child Agnes, who was only 1 or 2 years-old, 
			had died the previous month. Mary became the oldest living child of George and 
			Elizabeth. They lived in a small adobe house on the farm, until later when a 
			bigger home was built and the adobe house was turned into a granary. (There was 
			also a Salt Lake home.)

			<st1:City w:st="on">
				<st1:place w:st="on">Elizabeth</st1:place>
			</st1:City>'s daughters, Elizabeth and Sarah Leonora did most of that spinning.

			back, when back was turned to front and the dress used as a school dress, and a 
			new Sunday one made" (Elizabeth Taylor Boyes life sketch).
