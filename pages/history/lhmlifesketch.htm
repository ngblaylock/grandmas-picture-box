		<p>Lavina Harper Moses was born March 3, 1879 to Charles Alfred Harper and Mary 
			Boyes Harper, at Big Cottonwood, what is now known as Holladay, Utah. This was 
			also the birthplace of her husband, Jesse T. Moses, and thus they were closely 
			associated since early childhood.</p>
		<p>She received her early education in Holladay where she was a good student and 
			was admired and loved by her class mates for her cheerful personality. Later 
			on, as a teacher in the auxiliary organizations of the church, she showed skill 
			in this work and pointed the way to success thru love and kindness to many. She 
			lived as an example to follow and as a good teacher she would want her work to 
			carry on. Sister Moses kept a record of the important events in her life which 
			tells us o f the following: On June 15, 1892 she was sustained as assistant 
			secretary in the Big Cottonwood Primary and in May 1894 she was appointed 
			secretary. January 28, 1897 she was sustained secretary and treasurer of the 
			YLMIA association and as assistant secretary in the Big Cottonwood Sunday 
			School August 22, 1897. From 1897 to 1902 she held positions as teacher in both 
			the Primary and Sunday School organizations and was later sustained head 
			teacher. It was during this time she taught Brother Neils Anderson who is with 
			us today. He may be better able to tell her good leadership and some good 
			lifelong impressions she made upon him as a boy. Her chief objective was to 
			make truth live in the mind and soul. Sister Moses was set apart as second 
			counselor in the Primary organization at Big Cottonwood April 25, 1901, and 
			until November 1902 she was also a teacher in the Second Intermediate 
			Department in the Sunday School for the Holladay Ward.</p>
		<p>As a young girl, she showed talent in art and drama. She belonged to a dramatic 
			club in Holladay and took a part in many of its outstanding performances. She 
			enjoyed this work very much and was often called on to give readings at various 
			entertainments. Influenced by a near relative who was an artist, Sister Moses 
			painted several beautiful pictures. Among one, when finished, was a picture of 
			grandfather Woodruff's <A href="..\wilford\Wilford_Woodruff_Home,_Painting_Early_Home,_Hung_in_Nauvoo_Home.jpg">
				home</A>* in Vermont. Some of these paintings still hang in her home to be 
			cherished by her children as a beautiful memory of their mother's gentle touch.</p>
		<p>On September 23, 1903 she was married to Jesse T. Moses in the Salt Lake Temple, 
			Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. They lived at Big Cottonwood until 
			1906. It was here that their oldest daughter, Mary was born. They then moved to 
			Smithfield, Utah where they lived until 1914. In Smithfield, four more children 
			were added to their happy family: Harper, Arabelle, Lavina, and Valate. In true 
			pioneer fashion, she moved with her husband to Metropolis, Nevada, and 
			homesteaded there. Here she was active in Relief Society work and it was here 
			that two more children were born, Charles, and one daughter who died when three 
			weeks old. The Moses family moved to Lost River in 1918 and attended the Arco 
			Ward until the Lost River was organized a year later. Here two youngest 
			daughters, Fern and Leone, were born. Sister Moses was sustained as secretary 
			and treasurer of the Relief Society of this ward, in which capacity she 
			faithfully served until the family moved to the Blackfoot area where they still 
			reside.</p>
		<p>She came with her family to the Riverside ward in 1932, where she continued her 
			active, faithful services. She has been working as Work Director in the Relief 
			Society for a number of years, always willing and faithful until her health 
			failed a few years ago. It was in this position that I remember her best. I 
			have always admired her for her sincerity in her work and her pleasant smile in 
			everything she did. During the time Brother and Sister Moses have lived here, 
			they have seemed very devoted to each other with a common interest in attending 
			to their church work and rearing an honorable family. True to their pioneer 
			ancestry they have performed their duties and, made the best of life as it came 
			to them.</p>
		<p>Lavina Harper Moses, 77, departed this life at the family home, Monday 
			afternoon, June 25, 1956 after a lingering illness of ten years. She is 
			survived by her husband, and the following sons and daughters: Mrs. Earl 
			Durrant, Charles Moses of Blackfoot, J. Harper Moses and Mrs. Everett W. 
			Jorgensen of Parma, Mrs. Wilkie Noble of Moore, Idaho and Mrs. Augustus 
			Twitchell, Antimony, Utah. Three daughters have preceded her in death. She is 
			also survived by 35 grandchildren, 8 great grandchildren, and three brothers, 
			Joseph B. and Edwin B. Harper, Holiday, Utah, and William Harper of Mesquite, 
			Nevada.</p>
		<p>Now that her life's work is completed, certainly there remains with all, and 
			especially her family, a full measure of fond memories and an example which 
			will bring them comfort and consolation. May this sustaining influence help 
			them carry on and live their lives as she would have them do.</p>
		<p align="center">Life can be rich through grief and pain</p>
		<p align="center">Though great the loss, yet greater gain</p>
		<p align="center">Is ours when, after night is gone,</p>
		<p align="center">We face the splendor of the dawn.</p>
		<p align="center">Lord, give us faith to look and see</p>
		<p align="center">And know that all was meant to be</p>
		<p align="center">To catch the gleam from shining years</p>
		<p align="center">Beyond this heartache, through these tears.</p>

			poor eyesight.&nbsp;One copy of this painting is in Wilford Woodruff's Nauvoo 
			home. Another copy is in the&nbsp;Daughters of the Utah Pioneers museum in Salt 
			Lake City, Utah. The third copy is promised to Gay Nel Barzee and&nbsp;still 
			hangs in grandma's home. Grandma obtained the copy from her dad with the 
			promise it would be hung where everyone could see it.</P>
