		<p>During these two months I have done 80 endowments in the St. George temple. On 
			the 20<sup>th</sup> of May, Sylva and I gave up our apartment and moved our 
			belongings in my trailer house. I have been paying some attention to a widow 
			Sister Harriet Cardon. We have been doing quite a few sealings together. She is 
			a fine woman and loves the temple work. Our friendship grew and finally 
			developed into an affection for each other and on the 8<sup>th</sup> of June we 
			were married in the St. George temple for time. Prior to this time I had 
			received a notice that the Emeritus club meeting and baguet would be held in 
			the Brigham Young University. I had been a student at the school in the late 
			90's. I decided to go to this meeting and receive my certificate of membership. 
			Sylva was ready to go to Salt lake and prepare for her eye operation. Lavina 
			came to St. George and took us to Provo and Salt Lake. We took Harriet with us 
			and gave her an opportunity of meeting some of my folks. We stayed in Provo 
			over night with Dr. Darrol L. Moses, then the next night went up to Bountiful 
			and stayed with Phoebe and Archie Briggs, then back to St. George on Saturday. 
			We all enjoyed the trip very much. Harriet has a home within a block of the 
			temple which will make it quite convenient for us.</p>
		<p>After our marriage we took an extended trip thru Utah, Idaho, Oregon, and 
			Washington, getting acquainted with each other's families. We were both well 
			received by all. Harriet wrote up the details so I will not insert it here. 
			After coming back about the last of July we went to work again in the temple. 
			Besides the regular endowment work we did a lot of sealings on Harriet's 
			ancestral line.</p>
		<p>We planted a fall garden in September. The Radishes, chard, spinach, and lettuce 
			was all that amounted to anything. We spent about ten days the latter part of 
			September in Salt lake City. Most of the time in the genealogical library 
			checking over family group sheets. We put in the index department, sixty-one 
			sheets on my grandmother Moses' line, the Spencer line, and nine sheets on the 
			Fuller line, Harriet's ancestors. We came back on the bus by way of Richfield. 
			Lavina met us at the Junction at twelve o'clock at night. We stayed at her 
			place a couple of days then she brought us on to St. George on Thursday the 29<sup>th</sup>
			of September, 1960. Since then, we have worked in the temple every day it was 
			open. The temple closed Thursday night the 6<sup>th</sup> of October for 
			general conference. Friday, the 7<sup>th</sup>, I moved my trailer house from 
			the Sullivan place to our own lot and today I have spent fixing it up and 
			leveling it up. We also listened in on conference and I went to priesthood 
			meeting tonight.</p>
		<p align="center">Experiences of a Week</p>
		<p>This was in the early spring of 1960. This winter we lived in one of Charles 
			Sullivan's apartment just across the road North from the Temple. Monday I 
			helped Sylva with the washing. I got the machine ready, got the water out, 
			filled the rinse tub, as each turn was ready I rung them out, put them through 
			the rinse and got them ready for Sylva to hang out. In the afternoon, Walter 
			Sullivan and his wife cam over in his car, took us for a ride around the 
			outskirts of little valley, situated three or four miles South and West of St. 
			George. The soil is red and around the valley is a reef of lava rock. We came 
			back and set out on the road toward Enterprise to find some watercress, but we 
			missed the road to watercress spring and landed in a dead-end gulch in a 
			rancher's feed yard. The rancher was a very congenial man; Brother Sullivan, 
			being interested in cattle, they had something in common to talk about, so we 
			stayed and chatted for a few minutes. He told us how to find watercress spring. 
			It was getting late, so instead, we decided to go out to Barlockers turkey 
			processing plant and buy some turkey. (You can buy there a whole turkey or any 
			part you want.) We came back to our apartment and had turkey sandwich and 
			played a game of Chinese checkers. Tuesday the 16<sup>th</sup> was temple day 
			again. I took in a morning session then in the afternoon I was asked by 
			President McArthur if I would like to work in the baptismal font and be 
			baptized for a few; five of we patrons went and were baptized for 200. I was 
			baptized for 25. This was a new but thrilling experience for me to be baptized 
			for them in the same font that my grandfather Woodruff was baptized for the 
			signers of the Declaration of Independence. This was my first experience of 
			this kind for more than 60 years and at the age of 82 was quite a thrill. I am 
			trying at this time to do ten endowments a week and am keeping up the record 
			quite well.</p>
		<p align="center">An Account of our Trip, Summer of 1960, 9 July 1960</p>
		<p>Jesse and I left St. George July 9<sup>th</sup> on the Bonanza Air Line for our 
			trip to Idaho and Washington. We arrived in Salt lake City airport at 3:00 PM. 
			Marion and Amelia Alldredge met us at the airport. We stayed with them over 
			night and went to church with them the next day. Sunday evening my sister 
			Phoebe Briggs came and took us to her place in Bountiful. We were there a 
			couple of days visiting with friends and relatives there and in Salt Lake. We 
			were back to magna Tuesday night. Thursday morning Marion brought us to the 
			airport where we boarded the plane for Pocatello. (Harriet stood the trip fine 
			until we got to Boise where we changed planes for Pocatello. We go on a small 
			plane and it was pretty rough. We were delayed in Boise for four hours.) I, 
			Harriet, called one of my cousins. She came to the airport, took us home, and 
			called three of her sisters. They all gathered to her place and had a nice 
			dinner and a good visit with them. Back to the trip, we took the bus from 
			Pocatello to Blackfoot. Arrived in Blackfoot 14 July 1960. We spent four days 
			visiting with Jesse's folks, Mary and Charles families, then went to Idaho 
			Falls and spent four days in the temple and enjoyed it very much. We came home 
			Friday 22 July, my birthday.</p>
