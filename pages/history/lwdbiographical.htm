			family of twelve daughters and one son. Prior to his conversion, Charles did 
			not like the Mormons and when his wife became one, he told her he would not 
			walk down the street with a Mormon, do he walked down one side and she would

		<P class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Only by thrift and industry were
