		<P>I was born May 30, 1859 in Salt Lake City, Utah, the daughter of Sarah Brown and 
			Wilford Woodruff. About the first things I can remember was when I was about 
			two years old. We lived in the Northwest corner of the big Woodruff home-one 
			room down stairs and one room upstairs. Three of us children had the measles. I 
			was very sick and a lady came in and said I had the black measles. I was too 
			sick to care but mother was very excited.</P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">In a few months my Grandfather, Aphek Woodruff, died. I 
			remember him in his coffin. A few months later Mathias Cowley was drowned in 
			the Jordon River. When I was seven years old we moved in the Southwest corner 
			of the house with one room upstairs and one room downstairs. Here my brother 
			Newton was born. When he was a few months old we all had whooping cough. We 
			were so sick that mother had to carry us up stairs at night and downstairs in 
			the morning. Soon we moved in the little new adobe house consisting of five 
			rooms. Here my sister Mary was born.
			<o:p></o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">Father had a wonderful orchard and grape vineyard. When I was 
			8 years old I got poisoned and nearly died from eating the seeds of rhubarb. 
			When I was 9 years old I helped father bud a young orchard. In the spring he 
			took buds from trees, cut a little slit in the tiny trees and put the bud in 
			it. I held it in my fingers while he took white yarn and tied the bud. I 
			sometimes rode down the field in the wagon with the ox team.
			<o:p></o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">When I was 12 years old my first great sorrow came. President 
			Young wanted Father to help pioneer

				<st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Bear River</st1:PlaceName>
				<st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Valley</st1:PlaceType>
			</st1:place>. My brother Wilford was married but another brother was old enough 
			to take responsibility, so my mother moved to
			<st1:City w:st="on">Randolph</st1:City>,
			<st1:place w:st="on">
				<st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Rich</st1:PlaceName>
				<st1:PlaceName w:st="on">County</st1:PlaceName>
			</st1:place>
			with her family except my brother, Brigham who was two years older than me. He 
			stayed in the city to complete his education at the University. This was a 
			severe trial to me as there were no good schools or teachers there. I arrived 
			in
			<st1:City w:st="on">
				<st1:place w:st="on">Randolph</st1:place>
			</st1:City>
			on my 12th birthday. We lived in a tent six months. I went boat riding with my 
			sister in a tub on Little Creek. In the Fall we moved in our new home-the only 
			home in
			<st1:City w:st="on">
				<st1:place w:st="on">Randolph</st1:place>
			</st1:City>
			with an upstairs. Mother taught school two years and was secretary in the 
			Relief Society. I often attended these meetings with her. I taught Sunday 
			School, a class of nine little boys which I dearly loved and they returned the 
			love. I went to dances at early candle light and danced until eleven or twelve 
			o'clock then we had intermission and refreshments and danced from two until 
			four o'clock.
			<o:p></o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">At the age of sixteen I married Jesse T. Moses of Big 
			Cottonwood,
			<st1:place w:st="on">
				<st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Salt</st1:PlaceName>
				<st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Lake</st1:PlaceType>
				<st1:PlaceType w:st="on">County
			</st1:place>, June 14, 1875. Next April a little daughter came to us. In the 
			Fall we moved to Cottonwood and mother moved to
			<st1:City w:st="on">Smithfield</st1:City>,
			<st1:place w:st="on">
				<st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Cache</st1:PlaceName>
				<st1:PlaceType w:st="on">County</st1:PlaceType>
			</st1:place>. The following February we lost our baby.
			<o:p></o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">In March 1877, my eldest Brother David P. Woodruff married 
			Arabell Hatch. The next June my brother Brigham, having completed his 
			education, came with my husband, his brother Fred and myself to see mother in
			<st1:City w:st="on">
				<st1:place w:st="on">Smithfield</st1:place>
			</st1:City>. He had been away from her seven years and I hadn't seen her for 
			more than a year. We arrived there on Friday June 15, 1877. The next morning 
			before breakfast Brigham went to see the Bishop and school trustees about 
			teaching school. At breakfast David's wife wanted to go to the river to see her 
			folks, so she, David, Brigham, my husband, Fred Moses and my nine year old 
			brother
			<st1:City w:st="on">
				<st1:place w:st="on">Newton</st1:place>
			</st1:City>
			went to the river. My sisters stayed at home to help mother with dinner.
			<o:p></o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">At one o'clock David came racing home on horseback. He 
			staggered into the house, clasped mother in his arms and cried, "Oh he was too 
			good to live." He and
			<st1:City w:st="on">
				<st1:place w:st="on">Newton</st1:place>
			</st1:City>
			had taken the gun and went to the river and shot a duck. Brigham took off his 
			clothes and went in the water after the duck. While in the water he took a 
			cramp and drowned.<SPAN style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp; 
</SPAN>He was in the river for six days before they found his body. Both white man and 
			Indians combed the river night and day searching for the body. The Indians 
			found him. Mother lay at death's door for a month. I stayed with her for 
			another month. Then I went to my husband in
			<st1:place w:st="on">Cottonwood</st1:place>. I was ill for sometime.
			<o:p></o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">On January 28, 1878 my son Jesse Tilton Jr. was born, On 
			August 24, 1880, my daughter Sylva was born in
			<st1:place w:st="on">Cottonwood</st1:place>. The following November 22, we 
			started in company with Harvey Harper and family for
			<st1:State w:st="on">
				<st1:place w:st="on">Arizona</st1:place>
			</st1:State>. We had to handle the boat ourselves because there was no one to 
			help us. We arrived in
			<st1:State w:st="on">Arizona</st1:State>
			on the
			<st1:place w:st="on">Salt River</st1:place>
			in Jonesville. This place was afterwards called Lehi.
			<o:p></o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">Our tent was just nine feet by eleven feet, so we found an 
			adobe cabin with two door holes but no door and no floor. Just across the river 
			was a village with many Indians. Sometimes my husband had to leave me for three 
			or four days and nights at a time to work. The sun came up very early in the 
			morning and set very late at night and disturbed us. The Indians would come and 
			lift my quilts from the door and then look in and laugh at me.
			<o:p></o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">My husband made a bed by setting four posts in the ground, 
			nailing four posts around them and covering the top with poles and willows. 
			When it rained, we put tubs and pans on the bed to keep the bedding dry. In 
			March the heavy rains set in. An old gentleman by the name of Ross Rogers, 
			living 2 miles away, came to see how we were getting along. He put my baby and 
			myself into his wagon and told Jesse to load the things and leave as the 
			Indians would steal everything he had left. We went to live with him. He had 
			two rooms and eleven young children, none of them Married. We stayed there a 
			month. Mrs. Rogers had a good sewing machine. I, being a good seamstress, did a 
			lot of sewing for her while my husband freighted. We then moved into another 
			little cabin on the
			<st1:place w:st="on">
				<st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Tenpe</st1:PlaceName>
				<st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Canal</st1:PlaceType>
			</st1:place>. This cabin had two doors but no floor. The bridge was by the 
			north side of the house. The road going to
			<st1:place w:st="on">
				<st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Mesa</st1:PlaceName>
				<st1:PlaceType w:st="on">City</st1:PlaceType>
			</st1:place>
			was by the east side of the house so there was a continual stream, of travel 
			both ways, of both white and red men. I had Indians lying in my dooryard most 
			of the time.
			<o:p></o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">One day a tall young fellow wanted to come in. He gave me a 
			slight push. I picked up a hatchet and he jumped to the canal bridge, drew his 
			bow and arrow on the baby sitting on the ground. I stepped to the mantel and 
			picked up my loaded pistol and pointed it at him. He gave a whoop and run. He 
			didn't stop running until he reached the village. Some of the Indians told 
			Jesse he had a "he squaw" for a wife.
			<o:p></o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">We had all kinds of vermin to contend with. Jesse made the 
			same kind of bedsteads here as in the other cabin. We made a bed on the cedar 
			chest for little Jesse. One night he cried with an ear ache. His father was 
			going to get up to him.<SPAN style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp; 
</SPAN>I told him to light the candle first, which he did, and right beside the bed where 
			he would have put his foot was a tarantula, as large as a saucer. It is a hairy 
			legged spider that runs and jumps. My husband killed it with a club. One 
			morning I picked the baby's stocking up by the toe and a scorpion fell on my 
			finger. It happened to be a young one so a bath of alcohol and a poultice of 
			indigo cured it. We had to shake our bedding twice a day because we very often 
			found lizards in them. One night we shook a centipede out. It is a flat green 
			worm with dozens and dozens of legs on both sides, and deadly poison. It runs 
			very fast.
			<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">One evening a half dozen Indian men came into my yard. I 
			picked up my babies and locked the door with a padlock. My husband wasn't home, 
			so I went to my nearest neighbor and stayed all night. We moved upon the mesa 
			in December, after spending Christmas with our friends Harvey Harper and family 
			in Lehi. We had our cook stove in our little tent, and built a willow shed for 
			our bed room. I had a young girl staying with me. One morning I wasn't feeling 
			well. She came to my bed and told me that our tent was on fire. We had twelve 
			100-pound sacks of wheat in the tent. I called for help, and, living on the 
			banks of
			<st1:place w:st="on">
				<st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Montizamach</st1:PlaceName>
				<st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Canal</st1:PlaceType>
			</st1:place>, they soon put the fire out.
			<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">In the summer of 1882 we built a comfortable home consisting 
			of one large room with a fireplace in it and a porch on the back that faced the 
			East. We boarded up the South end and part of the East, making a kitchen where 
			we put our stove. During the summer small-pox broke out in our young city. Many 
			of the people had it. There were eighteen who died with it, seven of them being 
			in one family, by the name of Shepard. I could hear our undertaker across the 
			street making coffins day and night. He finally got the smallpox, but not very 
			bad. Later he went to the pest house and nursed the sick people there. My 
			husband, having a fine team of horses, was appointed to go to
			<st1:City w:st="on">
				<st1:place w:st="on">Phoenix</st1:place>
			</st1:City>
			to get supplies and medicine for the sick, as our city was quarantined. He had 
			to dodge the officers all the time. On November 18, my son Wilford Newton was 
			born. When he was a year and a half old I was sick and so was he. I came home 
			in April and stayed until October. The next July a large beautiful son was 
			born. We named him James Julian. The water did not agree with me there, and it 
			did not agree with the baby either; therefore, he only lived ten days. The next 
			July another son came to us, David Courtney. The water did not agree with him 
			but an old neighbor nurse came and cured him.&nbsp;
			<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">In the fall our city was stricken with typhoid fever causing 
			several deaths.<SPAN style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;</SPAN>I was one of the 
			sick victims. One lady died leaving eleven young children all unmarried. The 
			following April 1, with my children, I came home to my mother in
			<st1:City w:st="on">
				<st1:place w:st="on">Smithfield</st1:place>
			</st1:City>. My husband came in October and returned to
			<st1:State w:st="on">
				<st1:place w:st="on">Arizona</st1:place>
			</st1:State>
			in March and stayed there two years. Then he sold our place consisting of ten 
			acres of land covered with grapes, figs, peaches, and small fruits.
			<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">In 1889 we went to Grandpa James Moses farm, in Big 
			Cottonwood,
			<st1:place w:st="on">
<st1:City w:st="on">Salt Lake City</st1:City>, 
<st1:State w:st="on">Utah</st1:State></st1:place>. I remained there until my husband 
			returned from
			<st1:State w:st="on">
				<st1:place w:st="on">Arizona</st1:place>
			</st1:State>. In 1890 we moved to
			<st1:City w:st="on">Smithfield</st1:City>,
			<st1:place w:st="on">
<st1:City w:st="on">Cache 
County</st1:City>, 
<st1:State w:st="on">Utah</st1:State></st1:place>. On March 30, 1891 Grandpa Moses died. On 
			April 15, 1891 my son Clarence Frederick was born at my mother's home. The 
			following summer we built a nice comfortable home with seven rooms. We had our 
			first meal in it on Thanksgiving Day.
			<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">On June 5, 1887 twins came to us, a son and a daughter-Elmer 
			W. and Ethel W. On March 18, 1895 little Ethel died.<SPAN style="mso-tab-count: 1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</SPAN>This was a sad blow to us as our only daughter was nearly grown. The following June 
			we celebrated our 20th wedding anniversary. My parents were with us and we had 
			a very enjoyable time. On January 20, 1896, another little daughter, Phoebe 
			Esther was born. This was a great joy to us. On September 28, 1898, my father 
			Wilford Woodruff died. This was a sad blow to me. On November 11, 1898 Harry 
			Brown, my youngest son, was born. In April 1898, my son Jesse went on a 
			two-year mission to the central states. On June 14, 1901 my sister Mary died. 
			She was a teacher in the
			<st1:place w:st="on">
				<st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Provo</st1:PlaceName>
				<st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Academy</st1:PlaceType>
			</st1:place>. Her death was very sad because it left my mother all alone in her 
			home. Mother stayed there two years sending grandchildren to school.
			<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">Then she came and lived with me the remaining five years of 
			her life. This was a great pleasure to us as we all loved her so much. She 
			helped my children with their school work a great deal. She died May 9, 1910.
			<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">On November 22, 1903 my last child was born-a little 
			son-Brigham W. He died soon after his birth. I had pneumonia at the time and 
			came near going also. In 1904 we moved to a ranch 1 mile north of
			<st1:place w:st="on">
<st1:City w:st="on">Smithfield</st1:City>, 
<st1:State w:st="on">Utah</st1:State></st1:place>-where we lived until 1934. The Daughters 
			of the Utah Pioneers was first organized in
			<st1:City w:st="on">
				<st1:place w:st="on">Smithfield</st1:place>
			</st1:City>
			on September 14, 1905.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>It was 
			named after my mother Sarah Brown Woodruff, and I was elected the first 
			president of the organization with Kate Cragun as first counselor and Ellen 
			Timmins as second counselor. Zerviah S. Smith was the secretary and treasurer. 
			We worked together for years. I enjoyed this work very much.*
