			to Quaker parents, Jesse and Eleanor Evans Harper. The first children of 
			Charles and Lavina were twin daughters, born in
			<st1:place w:st="on">
<st1:City w:st="on">Montgomery County</st1:City>, 
<st1:State w:st="on">PA</st1:State></st1:place>, 28 Jul 1841, who died same day.
			<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
		<P class="MsoNormal">About this time the young couple became converted to The 
			Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, along with many others in
			<st1:place w:st="on">
<st1:City w:st="on">Chester County</st1:City>, 
<st1:State w:st="on">PA.</st1:State></st1:place>
			Prior to his conversion, Charles did not like the Mormons and when his wife 
			became one, he told her he would not walk down the street with a Mormon, so he 
			walked down one side and she would walk down the other side. They did this for 
			one year. One day he walked away from home and said he would be back soon. 
			Lavina started her washing and it was not very long before she heard him coming 
			home singing, seeming to be very happy. She looked up and saw that his clothes 
			were wringing wet and she said to him, "So you were baptized today, I knew you 
			would be without me asking you." He replied, "Yes, I did it today and I am the 
			happiest man alive." After becoming a member of the Church, the
			<st1:City w:st="on">
				<st1:place w:st="on">Providence</st1:place>
			</st1:City>
			(Quaker) meeting recorded: "Charles Alfred Harper has left Society of Friends 
			and joined the Mormon Society and is no longer a member amongst us."

		<P class="MsoNormal">When the Harpers arrived in Nauvoo, is not known. They were 
			not listed in the Nauvoo census of February 1842, but their next two children 
			were born there, John 1842 and Ellen 1846. They received their endowments in

			31 December 1845.
			<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">The Harpers were among the thousands who established Winter 
			Quarters on the west side of the
			<st1:place w:st="on">Missouri 
River</st1:place>. Because of his trade as carriage maker and wheelwright, Charles was 
			almost indispensable to the leaders of the Church in their preparations for the 
			westward trek. It was doubtless because of this skill that he was included in 
			the first pioneering migration, under Brigham Young, to the
			<st1:place w:st="on">
				<st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Salt</st1:PlaceName>
				<st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Lake</st1:PlaceType>

			</st1:place>. He left

				<st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Salt</st1:PlaceName>
				<st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Lake</st1:PlaceType>

			in Aug 1847 to return to Winter Quarters. His little daughter, Ellen, had died 
			27 Aug, at the age of 16 months.
			<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">Edwin B. Harper said, his grandfather, Charles Harper Sr. told 
			him, "His grandmother was a good tailor and while he was gone, she made enough 
			money to buy a wagon." With the arrival of spring, 1848, Charles, Lavina and 
			their 5 year old son, Harvey John, set out to rejoin the Saints in Salt Lake 
			Valley. Lavina was pregnant with her fifth child. She drove the heavily loaded 
			covered wagon and a pair of oxen most of the distance across the hot dusty 
			miles. As they neared
			<st1:City w:st="on">Fort Laramie</st1:City>,
			<st1:State w:st="on">Wyoming</st1:State>, it became apparent that she would 
			never reach
			<st1:State w:st="on">
				<st1:place w:st="on">Utah</st1:place>
			</st1:State>
			before the baby was born. They stopped the wagon; Charles Alfred Jr. was born 
			at 4:00 P.M., 23 July 1848.
			<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">After their arrival, they needed a home, a temporary shelter 
			for the coming winter. They built a dugout (cave) on Spring Creek (about 47th 
			South on the east side of the
			<st1:Street w:st="on">
				<st1:address w:st="on">Holladay Blvd</st1:address>
			</st1:Street>, a little Southeast of Phillips 66 Service Station) where it had 
			washed its bed deep as it left the foothills at the foot of the mountains. The 
			north bank was high above the stream. We do not know how long they lived there. 
			The next known place was an adobe home built where
