<p>Lola E. Jorgensen, we place our hands upon your head and set
you apart for a mission to Scandinavia, whereunto you have been
called by the prophet of god, and we seal upon you the spirit of
this calling and say unto you, inasmuch as your heart's desire is
to serve the: Lord and keep his commandments and live pure and
holy, the spirit of this office and calling shall rest upon you
and you shall be able to preach the gospel of life and salvation
to those whom you will come in contact. The Lord will bless you
and give you the language to convey your ideas and he will raise
up friends unto you who will help you and feed you and give you a
place of shelter and receive you in their houses. You shall be
blessed and strengthened by day and by night, and the Lord will
reveal unto you things that will comfort you, and you shall feel
that the Lord is with you and help you and strengthen you, and
you shall be able to overcome the weaknesses of your nature, and
you shall have strength in your body and marrow in your bones.
You shall be able to perform this mission to your own
satisfaction, for the Lord will help you in every respect if you
will keep yourself near unto Him. Subject yourself to the
authorities of the mission and be kind to your traveling
companions, and you shall always be on the safe side of the
question, and when the Lord blesses you with talent, always give
the honor and glory to Him. Go forth and spare not; lift up your
voice and proclaim the gospel and warn the inhabitants of the
nation where you shall labor, that they may understand that the
kingdom of the Son of God is near at hand. Testify that Joseph
Smith was a prophet of the living God in these last days and that
this is the gospel of life and salvation that you are bearing to
them. We say unto you, dear brother, inasmuch as you will keep
yourself pure, the Lord will bless you and give you many friends
and you shall rejoice and feel that these are the best days of
your life. We say unto you, dear brother, that you shall go in
peace and return in safety and be blessed in every respect. </p>

<p>We seal upon you every blessing that your heart can desire in
righteousness and reseal upon you all your former blessings and
ordinations, and we say unto you, receive this call and go forth
and be a servant of the living God in truth and deed. These
blessings, with all necessary blessings to qualify you for this
mission, we seal upon you in the name of Jesus, even so, amen.</p>

<p>Martin S. Lindsay,</p>
