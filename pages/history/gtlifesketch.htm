<p>Augustus Twitchell was the oldest child of William H. and
Nancy Ellen Openshaw Twitchell. He was born on June 7, 1909, at
Escalante, Utah, at the home of his grandfather, Edwin Twitchell.
Edwin Twitchell was one of the first settlers of Escalante.</p>

<p>He started school in Escalante, but when he was in his third
year his father took the family to John&#146;s Valley, where he
had acquired a farm. They were doing quite well on the farm, and
then his father decided to sell and to move to Leeds, near St.
George. Gus was twelve years old at the time, and he remembers
riding a horse and driving cattle all the way to Leeds. This was
a very unfortunate move as the deal in Leeds proved worthless and
they returned to John&#146;s Valley with nothing. They were left
with a small herd of sheep, which they had rented to a neighbor
before they had moved to Leeds. From then on the going was rough.
Gus&#146; father had a stroke and was unable to make a good
living for the family.</p>

<p>The children went to school in a one-room schoolhouse a few
miles north of the town of Widstoe. It was called Henderson. They
have told me how the snow was so deep that it covered the fences,
and the drifts were so frozen that they could walk over them. Gus&#146;
schooling ended with the eighth grade. His father could not
afford to send him away for high school and he was needed at home
to help take care of the sheep. This responsibility rested mostly
on him, and he herded them all over the hills around John&#146;s
Valley. Someone said they had seen his name carved on every large
quaking aspen on the mountain.</p>

<p>Gus loved to read, and he gained much of his education by
reading good books and magazines while herding sheep, including
the Book of Mormon. When his own boys were in high school, he
used to read their history and geography books. He had a very
good memory and retained most of what he read.</p>

<p>At one time the town of Widstoe was quite an active community,
and both young and old enjoyed the dances and ward dinners and
parties that were held on a regular basis. Gus recalled that he
enjoyed these along with outdoor activities. There were lots of
young people and they enjoyed getting together for an evening of
fun. He was fairly active in church, but he was quite backward
about taking part.</p>

<p>His father died just before Gus turned nineteen, leaving his
mother with a family of eight children, the youngest being two
years old. This left him with a great responsibility, but being a
steady, hardworking boy, he took it in stride and did the best he
could with what they had. He and his brother Ralph went into the
CCC camp to help out, and Arthur took care of the sheep with the
help of friends.</p>

<p>In the early 1930&#146;s the water supply in the area dwindled
to such an extent that many of the farmers were forced to leave
the area. Then the government bought out those who wanted to
sell, and they scattered out to many locations. Gus and his
mother and brothers decided to settle in Antimony. The Center
Creek Ranch was for sale, so they bought it and from then on
things were much improved for them. The farm was productive, and
by having a good garden and chickens and milk cows along with the
sheep, they were able to enjoy life more fully. This proved to be
a very good move for the family</p>

<p>In 1938 Bishop Herbert Gleave asked Gus if he would go on a
mission. He accepted the call and left for the Southern States
mission in March. He filled an honorable mission, which helped
him to fill many church callings after he returned. While in the
mission field he met a lady missionary who was to become his wife.
We were married on December 23, 1940, in the Logan Temple.</p>

<p>Gus and I lived at the Center Creek Ranch until the first of
April and then rented a ranch on the Antimony bench, which was to
become our home for the next thirty years. We worked hard to get
the land ready to plant crops. The farm had been neglected so we
did not do as well as we had hoped, but the second year we raised
a good crop of grain, hay and potatoes. The third year we bought
the farm, and with hard work and good care we were blessed with
good harvests and we were able to pay for the farm in three years.
A grazing permit for thirty head of cattle came with the farm and
over the years we acquired more until we had built up a good herd
of cattle. Gus was a good farmer and took great pride in his
work, both in taking care of his land and cattle. Many times I
have seen him look out over a field of hay and say &quot;Isn&#146;t
it beautiful!&quot;</p>

<p>I think the fact that he had so little when he was growing up
made him appreciate more the good things that he had later on. On
a cold winter night he would come in from chores and say &quot;Isn&#146;t
it nice to have a warm home to live in and to know that there is
plenty of feed for the livestock?&quot; He worked hard for what
he had, but he gave full credit to his Father in Heaven for his
health and his blessings.</p>

<p>Gus was a faithful tithe payer, and he was generous in his
contributions to the church. He fulfilled his church callings to
the best of his ability and supported me in all of mine. He was
proud of his boys and was happy when they achieved. He was
interested in their school activities, and he attended banquets,
games, plays, graduations, junior proms, etc.</p>

<p>He loved to go out in the mountains and derived much enjoyment
from camping out and riding around the hills in his jeep or on
his horse. He loved to hunt, but was not much of a fisherman.
Every summer we took our boys on a campout for two or three days.
We often took a picnic lunch and spent the day in the hills. He
was sympathetic toward those who were ill or who had hardships,
but he had no patience for neglect or laziness.</p>

<p>Gus enjoyed good health and was able to do his work until
March 1970. At that time he suffered a heart attack, and on July
15, 1970, he passed away quietly at home.</p>
