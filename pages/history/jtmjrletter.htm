		<P>Dear Leone,</P>
		<P>I guess you think I have ignored your request for some experiences of 
			grandfather Woodruff, but your letter with others and lot of other things, 
			needed my immediate attention- so I will try now to give you some personal 
			experiences that are not written in his life history.</P>
		<P>My first experience with him occurred while but an infant. In the spring of 1878 
			grandfather had just been released as president of the St. George temple and 
			had arrived home mother called him in to give me a blessing; I was a very sick 
			child and she thought I could not live, but after giving me the blessing he 
			told mother I would live to the full stature of manhood. I have often thought 
			of this promise when confronted with danger.</P>
		<P class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">When between the ages of 15 and 17 
			I visited him occasionally as the school I was attending was only two or three 
			miles from his home. On one occasion I walked from school to his place to spend 
			the night with him. I arrived at his home just before he came from his office. 
			He drove a horse and buggy. This was his 86<SUP>th</SUP> year. He drove in the 
			yard, put his horse in the barn, and un-harnessed them and fed them. Then we 
			went around and through the barn, gathered the eggs which he carried to the 
			house in his tall silk hat, stating that his hat was the handiest thing he had 
			to carry them in. As we approached the house his daughter Alice was just 
			getting home from school. She passed by us without speaking and he called her 
			back saying, "
			<st1:City w:st="on">
				<st1:place w:st="on">Alice</st1:place>
			</st1:City>
			you didn't speak to Jesse."
			<st1:place w:st="on">
				<st1:City w:st="on">Alice</st1:City>
			</st1:place>
			apologized and went on her way.</P>
		<P class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">In the summer of 1885, I being in 
			my eighth year, Mother came up from
			<st1:place w:st="on">
				<st1:City w:st="on">Mesa</st1:City>
				<st1:State w:st="on">Arizona</st1:State>
			</st1:place>
			and brought her three children with her. While on a visit to
			<st1:place w:st="on">
				<st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Salt</st1:PlaceName>
				<st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Lake</st1:PlaceType>
			</st1:place>
			we had the privilege of an outing up City Creek canyon with grandfather 
			Woodruff. He and some of his sons-in-law did some fishing. Some of his 
			sons-in-law wanted to fish on Sunday, but to their disappointment he told them 
			we would keep the Sabbath day Holy. So there was no fishing that day. There 
			were a number of us children there and we enjoyed ourselves very much in 
			playing games to our liking.
		</P>
		<P class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">My last personal experience with 
			grandfather Woodruff was the day I left for my mission. Three hours before 
			boarding the train that would take me to my field of labor (headquarters at
			<st1:place w:st="on">
				<st1:City w:st="on">Chicago</st1:City>
			</st1:place>), I went to his office and talked for half an hour with him. This 
			was the 13<SUP>th</SUP> of April 1898. After spending a couple of days in
			<st1:City w:st="on">Chicago</st1:City>
			I was appointed to labor in
			<st1:State w:st="on">
				<st1:place w:st="on">Missouri</st1:place>
			</st1:State>. While there I spent some time at
			<st1:place w:st="on">Far West</st1:place>
			and would occasionally go to the temple lot and sit on the cornerstone where 50 
			years before grandfather Woodruff was ordained an Apostle.
		</P>
		<P class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Today is the 24<SUP>th</SUP> of 
			July. Mom and I have been to a senior citizens party, listened to a fine 
			program, and had a lovely dinner sponsored by the two stake Relief societies.
		</P>
		<P class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">I have talked with a number of the 
			old citizens of St. George who were acquainted with grandfather 
			Woodruff-especially the Atkin family. They lived several miles South and West 
			of St. George. They had a large pond surrounded by heavy cattails and rushes. 
			This made a good hiding place from the marshals who were hunting all the 
			authorities of the church and putting them in prison, and exacting heavy fines 
			from them.
		</P>
		<P class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">I will write you a page or two 
			from a little book called, <I style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">The Story of 
				Atkinville, </I>gotten up by the Atkin family and which includes some 
			history of grandfather's activity while in St. George. Grandfather states that 
			on August 7<SUP>th</SUP> 1886 "1 arrived in St. George and slept in the home of 
			John and Emma Squires, in the same bed where I slept for six months last year." 
			Emma Squires (Little) told the writers (interview, April 20, 1956) that when 
			Wilford Woodruff lived at her place he had a room upstairs where he always 
			retreated when someone knocked, before she opened the door. She had to be very 
			careful not to let anyone know he was there.
		</P>
		<P class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The home was near the red hill and 
			had orchards and vineyards at the rear of the house where Wilford Woodruff 
			occasionally went hunting for quail in a disguise that Emma made for him (a 
			sunbonnet and a Mother Hubbard dress). Despite the disguise, an inquisitive 
			neighbor met and recognized him in the rear of the house as he was returning 
			from the hill. He had to find a new place to live immediately.</P>
		<P class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">This was the main reason that sent 
			him to Atkinville. The reason why Wilford Woodruff visited or moved to 
			Atkinville on given dates is not clearly revealed, although a few hints are 
			given: For example, on February 23, 1887 "Marshall Armstrong arrived in the 
			evening in St. George." Three days later, February 26<SUP>th</SUP>, Wilford 
			stated, "I took my bed and luggage with Brother Thompson and went to William 
			Aitkin's to stop awhile." He stayed more than three months. Further light is 
			shed by his statement on January 31, 1885. "I rode to Brother Atkins, visited 
			his pond; two boys had set fire to his rushes and flags (cattails) all around 
			his pond so there was no hiding places to get the wild fowl, or for any other 
			purpose." He did not visit Atkinville again until June 29<SUP>th</SUP> after 
			the cattails had re-grown.
		</P>
		<P class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The best explanation for his 
			visits and retreats to Atkinville is given by the Atkin family tradition. It 
			was the safest place he could find in the region. He developed confidence in 
			the hospitality, dependability and loyalty of the family. Besides, there were 
			thickets of tamaracks lining the river bottom land and the tules of the pond 
			into which he could quickly flee with little fear that the marshals could find 
			him.
		</P>
		<P class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The saints in St. George were 
			loyal and true to the harassed brethren. Emma Squires Little said that her 
			father William Thompson regarded himself as Wilford Woodruff's bodyguard and 
			was especially vigilant in keeping track of the marshals.
		</P>
		<P class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">An alert at Atkinville started a 
			chain reaction. Nellie Atkin, a girl of ten, played an important part in the 
			watch for the marshals; She would be seated at the top of the hill east of the 
			house where she could watch the road, and if she saw the buggy of the marshals 
			McGeary and Armstrong coming around the dugway, it was a signal for a quick 
			move. They would rush to get Brother Woodruff his bedroll, food and water, his 
			books, and fishing tackle-and put it into the large boat (15 x 5 feet) where 
			Wilford would remain safely concealed in the heavy cattails and rushes. When 
			asked if the marshals could see him from the bluffs above the pond, Wilford 
			said "there were plenty of places to hide where neither the marshals from the 
			hill, the devil from below nor the Lord from above could see the boat." When 
			the danger was past William went out to the pond made a noise like a duck and 
			Wilford gave a signal quack in reply.</P>
		<P class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">I have visited Nellie Atkin 
			Nordine several times since I have lived in St. George, on one visit she showed 
			me a letter "Grandpa Allen" as she called him, wrote to her. It was dated 
			September 3, 1887, and was an answer to a letter she had written. He said "I 
			read your letter to some of the apostles and a room full of people-and they 
			were much pleased. They thought you were a brave young lady who was willing to 
			do so much to defend the life and interest of the president of the church. But 
			I don't wish to put my little lady Nellie to so much trouble and danger. I have 
			a large stout man who goes with me every where, night and day, carries two 
			pistols and a double-barrel shot gun, and says he will shoot the marshals if 
			they come to take me (don't tell anybody of this)-so I am pretty well guarded. 
			I miss you in buttoning up my shoes. I don't stop at home any nights, so
			<st1:City w:st="on">
				<st1:place w:st="on">Alice</st1:place>
			</st1:City>
			can't button my shoes, and I have to ask some big man that will weigh about 200 
			pounds to button my shoes. And he is so awkward about it I wish I had my Nellie 
			with me."</P>
		<P class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">On his two to four-day trips to 
			St. George, during his sojourn at Atkinville, he spent most of his time in the 
			St. George temple in a room he had prepared for his own use. A story is told of 
			a Swiss Bishop from
			<st1:place w:st="on">
				<st1:City w:st="on">Santa 
Clara</st1:City>
			</st1:place>
			who said in a prayer in Sunday meeting, "...and bless the marshals that they 
			may not bother he who is hiding in the St. George temple."</P>
		<P class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Charles L. Walker was night guard 
			at the temple from the time of it's completion in 1877 until his death in 1904. 
			He possessed a beautiful Colt revolver and was a good shot. His revolver was 
			always at hand beside the bible in his hut at the temple. When Wilford Woodruff 
			or other high authorities were on the underground in St. George, Charles' 
			trusty Colt was always handy where he could grasp it quickly.and it was loaded.</P>
