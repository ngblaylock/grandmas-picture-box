<p>Sister Maria Elizabeth Waite Jorgensen:</p>

<p>In the authority of the Holy Melchizedek Priesthood and in the
name of Jesus Christ I lay my hands upon your head to give unto
you a patriarchal blessing. Father in heaven draw near unto us
upon this occasion for this thy handmaiden has come to me as thy
servant desiring that she may have a blessing, and dictate to me
the blessing Thou has in store for her. </p>

<p>Dear sister thou art a chosen vessel in the eyes of God our
Father. You rifled your first estate in the spirit world with
honor and have been permitted to come to earth in this day and
age when the gospel has come to earth, and you have striven to
keep the commandments of God. </p>

<p>You are a mother in Israel and the Lord loves you for you have
been faithful in that line. You have lived in peace with your
husband, and your family has learned to love you. They have been
born under the new and everlasting covenant and they will be an
honor to you, and your heart will rejoice as it has from
childhood. Your posterity will be numbered among the faithful
ones in the earth. They will be God-fearing men and women and
defend the principles of eternal truth, and God will pour out His
spirit upon them. </p>

<p>Be of good cheer for you are of Ephraim through the loins of
Joseph, and every blessing God has promised to his handmaidens
you are entitled to, and through your faith and integrity He will
bless you. Peace will whisper to your heart and joy will fill
your soul, and you will be one who all mankind will look to as
one of the noble daughters of God. I bless you with every
blessing which is in store for His faithful daughters. Continue
your faithful labors and live near to Him; make Him your friend
and you will be able to continue your work. </p>

<p>I seal you up against the power of the destroyer and pray God
you will have strength to resist the temptations as they come to
you through life, and you will know God has heard your prayers
when trials and troubles come to you but you will be comforted
and you will know He is your friend. </p>

<p>Be humble; be prayerful and faithful, and with your husband
you will journey together through life. I bless you with health
and strength that you will live long upon the earth and your
children and children&#146;s children for I bless you with a
large posterity. </p>

<p>I seal you up to come forth in the morning of the first
resurrection clothed with glory, immortality and eternal life,
and I do it in the name of Jesus Christ and as a patriarch, Amen.
</p>
