<p>The Father spoke; a silence came over the vast concourse of
spirits. While they listened with breathless stillness; these
words echoed from group to group until they reached the uttermost
parts of that great spirit world. The earth is now organized and
ready for the temporal abode of man.</p>

<p>The sons of God shouted for joy and the morning stars sang
together. Then all were busy in arranging themselves in groups
congenial. Some through their efforts have acquired greater
knowledge than others. Some have been more valiant in the cause
of truth. Many have become great and noble sons of God. As all
could not come to earth at once it was the privilege of those in
authority to send from each rank those whom they desired to
people the earth in its different periods. When my turn came to
receive the message, I was informed I must wait until the eve of
the sixth period. I may have felt a little disappointed but
pleased to abide by the wish of the Father for I felt that he
knew best.</p>

<p>I came into the world a descendant of Abraham, one of Gods
chosen servants from the beginning. The Lord had proven him in
the spirit world, and determined to prove him in this life by
permitting him to come in a land of idiolatry and of parents who
did not believe in God. Abraham arose above these conditions,
obtained the priesthood and the blessings and covenants of the
Lord to him and his posterity to the latest generation.</p>

<p>I have indeed been favored by being born of goodly parents and
established in this land of freedom, a land that was given to the
sons of Joseph for an everlasting inheritance. Also at a time
when the covenants made to Abraham, and the priesthood have been
restored to his posterity. I have been brought up in the various
steps of the priesthood and have enjoyed the privileges and
blessings it affords. Have had the privilege of bearing the
message of truth to the world and laboring some in the temples
for the redemption of some who have not had the privilege of
receiving the covenant while in earth life. I have a knowledge
that my future state depends upon the life I live here. It is my
constant desire and prayer to live that I may meet with gladness
my friends and associated when my mission is done here.</p>
