<p>ALVARETTA LEORA JORGENSEN CHRISTENSEN was born January 17,
1886, in Logan, Cache County, Utah, in a frame house at 33 East
on 4th North. The house was torn down in the spring of 1964 for
an Albertson&#146;s Super Market to be built, HER FATHER IS ISAAC
J0RGESEN who was born February 21, 1857, in Brigham City, Box
Elder County, Utah, to Hans Jorgensen born in Boderslev Odense,
Denmark November 29, 1795 and to Dorthea Christensen (or Andersen).</p>

<p>HER MOTHER IS REBECCA NIELSEN who was born September 9, 1861,
in Aalborg, Denmark to Lars Larsen Nielsen born October 6, 1830,
in Agerescad Voeragen, Denmark and to Dorthea M. Thomsen who was
born in Hailing Sogn, Denmark, February 24, 1338.</p>

<p>Ret, as many know her, was baptized into the Church of Jesus
Christ of Latter Day Saints, the summer following the January she
turned eight, in the Big Ditch in Hyde Park, Utah by George
Seamons on a Wednesday, August 1, 1894 and Suel Lamb confirmed
her on Thursday, August 2, 1894. The first Thursday of the month
was Fast Day in those days, That Wednesday was a beautiful day
and Maidie Seamons, who was baptized that day too by her father,
said, &quot;Now Ret, close your eyes and your mouth when they
push you under the water!&quot; </p>

<p>Alvaretta had a Patriarchal Blessing given to her by Christian
J. Larsen, November 15, 1908, with &quot;the blessings of
Motherhood and the blessings of health and strength, both body
and mind that you shall be able to bear up under every burden
that may be placed upon you and you shall live to obtain every
blessing that you have come upon this earth to receive.&quot; </p>

<p>Ret attended school in a two room rock school house two blocks
south and one block west of her father&#146;s home in Hyde Park,
Later another one room cement school house for the seventh and
eighth grades was built just north of the Rock School House,
where she completed the eighth grade. She attended the &quot;A.C.&quot;,
Utah Agricultural College, one year before she was married and
for one quarter after she was married. She studied Home Economics
under Miss Holmgren. </p>

<p>Most of her childhood memories are of Hyde Park where she
milked cows, fed pigs, learned how to wash and iron and clean
house. One day while peeling pears with her sisters, sister
Orilla wanted her knife and pulled it from her hand cutting the
tendon in her first finger. The girls had her hold her hand in a
tub of cold water from the ditch until &quot;Pa and Ma&quot; came
home and the: they took her to Dr. Osmond. That&#146;s the reason
she has a stiff first finger pointing all the time. Christmases
were happy times when her Mother would make rag dolls for the
girls and her father would get either skates or sleighs for the
boys. Her father would bring home a case of oranges and a gunny
sack of peanuts for a merry time0 The Primary always had a
Christmas tree with gifts for all, but one Christmas her Mother
said they could not go because they had not been attending like
they should. They were all sitting around the fire in the kitchen
when Santa Claus came in the door. Ret saw him and flew across
the room and onto the bed, in the next room where her Mother and
Father were sleeping. Even after Uncle George Nielsen took off
his mask Ret would not go near him. </p>

<p>Ret was born scared. She was afraid of the dark arid noises
like when the pigs got loose and came grunting at the door. The
boys loved to scare the girls and used sheets over their heads,
especially on Halloween and Ret was afraid to go out of the door
after dark, not even to the back house </p>

<p>When Retta got older, she would go with her father to the farm
across the Bear River west of Smithfield at threshing and haying
time to cook for twenty to thirty men. Sometimes her sister Vera
and Rhoda would help. They would stay for the week days and then
go home Saturday for Church on Sunday. They cooked in the Sheep
Camp and on a stove outside and then serve the men in another one
room old house on the tarn. Every day that floor had to be
scrubbed Sam Christensen would often ride his horse out to see
Retta in the middle of the week! </p>

<p>Sam Christensen asked Retta to marry him one summer Sunday
evening in 1904. The next Wednesday he gave her a gold ring with
three pearls. It was the prettiest ring Ret had ever seen but she
was afraid to show it to her Father. She put it in the trunk and
then talked to her Mother about it. Her Mother was happy but her
father said, &quot;Where did he get it?, from the 15 cent store?&quot;
When Sam asked Ret&#146;s Father for her hand in marriage, he
gave Sam a long lecture on</p>

<p>how terrible she was but ended with &quot;She&#146;s a
lightening striker but she&#146;ll be good to you if you are good
to her.&quot; </p>

<p>Lars Samuel Christensen and Alvaretta Leora Jorgensen were
married June 21, 1905, in the Logan Temple. A Wedding Reception
was held &quot;Wednesday, June 21st, 1905, at their residence at
Hyde Park, Utah, at five o&#146;clock.&quot; A dance was held
that evening in the old Meeting House north of the present Hyde
Park Chapel and the whole town came.</p>

<p>In April of 1907, Sam was called on a mission to Denmark and
Alvaretta lived with his folks and worked at Frank Lee&#146;s
store. When Sam returned, he went to school at the B.Y.C. and the
A.C. and in 1911 graduated from Utah Agricultural College and
then accepted a job with the L.D.S. Business College in Salt Lake
City.</p>

<p>Sam and Ret moved around a lot during their married life -- if
not town to town, it was from house to house in Logan. Ret
cleaned a lot of houses before they finally bought one on 243
West Center Street in Logan. They had moved from Logan to Burley,
Idaho and Whitehall, Montana and then to Logan and then to
Belmond, Iowa with the Amalgamated Sugar Company and the Great
Western Sugar Company. Back in Logan in 1930, Sam worked as a
field man for the Federal Land Bank of Berkley, California.</p>

<p>Ret worked in the Church in the Primary Presidency and as a
Trailbuilder Teacher and as a Relief Society teacher and visiting
teacher. She was a member of the Daughters of the Utah Pioneers
-- Ballard Camp in Logan and Ensign Camp in Salt Lake City. </p>

<p>Retta and Sam had five children -- three girls and two boys.
To tell about each will tell much about their life teachings to
them. </p>

<p>Sam, as President of the Logan Rotary Club, and Ret traveled
to Cleveland, Ohio for the National Rotarian Convention in 1923
or 1924 and after the convention they traveled to the East Coast
and Washington D. C. While in New York they visited the Niagara
Falls. In 1940, they bought a new Buick and took their family for
a trip through the middle west to Minnesota to get Sybil and
bring her back to Utah by way of Yellowstone. </p>

<p>Alvaretta Leora was a hard worker in everything she attempted.
She was a good homemaker, had a clean house, was a good cook and
enjoyed sewing for her sister&#146;s children as well as her own.
She loved making quilts and canning fruits and vegetables. She
loved to serve food to her friends and family. She had a hard
time changing to an automatic washer and dryer because boiling
clothes and hanging those beautiful white clothes in the sun was
a joy to her. Moving everything out of the house and scrubbing
and beating it clean before returning it was a must every once or
twice a year. </p>

<p>In 1957, Sam and Ret moved to Salt Lake City to live with
their daughter, Sybil. Sam died of a heart attack on September 12,
1964 -- eighty years of age. </p>

year -- eighty-nine years and five months old -- and has given

they with her children love her very much and are amazed at her
abilities at such a tender age. </p>
