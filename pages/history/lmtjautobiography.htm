<p>My parents Jesse Tilton Moses, Jr., son of Jesse Tilton Moses
Sr., and Phoebe Arabell Woodruff and Lavina Harper, daughter of
Charles Alfred Harper Jr. and Mary Boyes were married September
23, 1903, in the Salt Lake Temple. I was born June 30, 1910 in
Smithfield Cache County. Utah, the fourth of nine children. My
brothers and sisters were Mary, Jesse Harper, Arabell, Vilate,
Charles, Erma, who died in infancy, Fern and Leone. My parents
were both born and raised in Big Cottonwood, which is now part of
Salt Lake City. My parents and grandparents moved to Smithfield
and purchased a mice farm. My father built a neat little yellow
brick house near his fathers home and I was born in that house.</p>

<p>One of my earliest recollections was a large raspberry patch
with a path through the middle I made many trips over that path
to my grandparents place. When the berries were ripe, it was mice
to pick and eat them as I walked along the path.</p>

<p>My grandparents kept bees and in the fall when the honey was
gathered Grandma made a huge batch of honey candy. We children
were all given a piece to stretch. It was fun living close to my
grandparents. We had lots of fun times.</p>

<p>When I was five, my father went to Nevada to homestead some
land. This was not a good move as water was scarce and
jackrabbits were not. They ate the grain and other crops as soon
as they began to show in the spring. The three years that we
lived in Nevada were not happy ones. My mother had a baby
daughter who lived only three weeks. This was a great sorrow to
our family. My brother Charles was also born there. The last
winter we were there, we children all had scarlet fever and were
very sick. My sister Mary almost died, but through our faith and
prayers she recovered.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1917, we moved to Lost River, Idaho where my
father bought a farm. I had started school in Nevada so I was in
the second grade when we moved to Idaho. I enjoyed the five years
we lived in Lost River, though we lived on a farm and there was
much work to do. I helped herd the cows, weed the garden, and
other chores that I was old enough to help with. A very important
event took place in my life. I was baptized in the Lost River
July 6, 1918, and confirmed the next day at church. I was proud
to be a member of the church.</p>

<p>We had neighbors who had children our age so we had fun
playing together. There was a canal close by where we could swim
and in the summer evening we would play outside games. Sometimes
mother and dad played ball with us which we thought was great.</p>

<p>Thanksgiving, Christmas and birthdays were always special.
Mother was an excellent cook and always fixed such mice dinners.
These are all such special memories for me.</p>

<p>I enjoyed my years in elementary school. There were four of us
girls who were very close friends and we had fun taking part in
plays and programs we had for holidays and special occasions.</p>

<p>In 1918, the flu epidemic hit our little community. Our family
was all sick at the same time. My uncle lived close by, and he
looked after us. He did the chores and got things at the store
for us. I don't know what we would have done without him.</p>

<p>My sister and I were very sick and were down for three weeks,
but the rest of the family was up and about in a few days.</p>

<p>World War I was taking place at this time and my father was
called to register for the draft. He came home from town with a
big smile on his face and said the war had ended. You can imagine
how happy we were.</p>

<p>When my sister Mary graduated from eighth grade she went to
Smithfield and stayed with our grandparents and went to high
school. Then when my older brother was ready for high school, we
moved to Blackfoot where we would be close to high school for the
rest of us. I was in seventh grade so I went to junior high. I
did quite well in all my classes except math, which was always
hard for me, but I made it. During my eighth grade year I was
neither absent nor tardy so I received a certificate at
graduation. Now I was ready for high school.</p>

<p>My first three years went along quite smoothly but the fall of
my senior year my brother Charles and my mother both had small
pox and were very sick. Of course we were quarantined so I missed
several weeks of school. Then my father rented a large farm in
the little town of Pingree so we moved out there about seventeen
miles from Blackfoot. This caused me to miss a year of school.
There was a two-year high school in Pingree so I went to a half
year and picked up two credits, which helped in my senior year in
Blackfoot. The next winter my sister Vilate and I rented a room
in a friend&#146;s home and I finished high school and graduated
in May 1930.</p>

<p>The next two years I stayed at home and helped my father and
mother. The great depression had begun and it was almost
impossible for girls to find work. My older brother was married,
also my sister Mary. My sister Arabell was working as a secretary
in the Logan Temple. The fall of 1932 a lady in Blackfoot called
and wanted me to come and work for her. She was a partial invalid
and needed help in her home. I was glad for this opportunity to
earn some money. I worked for the Howell family for three years.
Then I felt a desire to fill a mission and began to make
preparations to go.</p>

<p>I was happy and excited when I received my call to the
Southern States. I spent ten days in the mission home in Salt
Lake City, which was a great experience. We left Salt Lake at 10:00
p.m. December 3, 1936 on the D &amp; R railroad and arrived in
Atlanta, Georgia December 6. That evening we attended a
Missionary meeting and were assigned our companions. My companion
was Sister Nelda Bills and she was a jewel. I began my mission in
Savannah, Georgia. Sister Bills was an excellent missionary and
helped me get a good start. She and I have kept in touch over the
years. I spent three months in Savannah, nine months in Macon,
Georgia, and six months in Montgomery, Alabama.</p>

<p>I enjoyed my mission very much and a very important event
happened to me. I met my future husband, Elder Augustus Twitchell
in the little town of Mognolia, Alabama where we had gone to a
branch conference. He came from the small community of Antimony,
Utah.</p>

<p>After we came home we kept in touch and it wasn&#146;t long
until we knew we were in love. After a short courtship we were
married in the Logan Temple December 23, 1940. We spent Christmas
at my parent&#146;s home in Riverside, a farming community five
miles out of Blackfoot. They had bought a farm and built a home
on it. On New Years day we loaded my things in our car and drove
to Antimony. I began to wonder what I had got myself into but I
soon got acquainted with his family. There were six boys and two
girls. Gus was the oldest, then Howel, Ralph, Zelma, Arthur,
Melba, Clarence, and Ephraim. Gus s father, William Henry
Twitchell, died March 24, 1938, so I never met him but some day I
will. Gus&#146; mother, Nancy Ellen Openshaw, was a very nice
person. She was so kind and helpful to me and I loved her dearly.
We lived at the Center Creek ranch for a while as the boys were
sorting potatoes and doing other work.</p>

<p>One day a friend came to see Gus and ask if he would like to
rent his farm. We quickly took his offer, as we needed a place to
live. The farm was located on the Antimony bench and we were soon
moved into the small home and were happy. We worked hard to get
the land ready for spring planting. We planted a garden that
produced a lot of nice vegetables and in late summer fruit
peddlers came to our town so I was able to can what fruit we
needed.</p>

<p>In September 1941 Mr. Woodard, the man who owned the farm,
died of complications following surgery. We rented the farm from
his wife for a year and then bought it. With hard work and good
management we raised good crops and soon had it paid for. With
eighty acres of good farmland and a cattle permit, we made a good
living. I always raised a garden and canned lots of fruit,
vegetables and meat so my fruit room was always full. Over the
years I cooked many meals for hired help. In 1941 World War II
started. Three of Gus&#146; brothers were drafted into the Army.
Arthur, Clarence and Ephraim were all in training in Camp
Roberts, California at the same time. Arthur was sent to France,
where he was killed in action. This, was a great sorrow to the
family. Clarence went to the South Pacific and Ephraim to Italy.
They both returned home. We were all happy when the war ended.</p>

<p>Our first child, Dennis, was born February 8, 1942. Our second
son David was born February 20, 1944. Our third son Terry came to
us April 23, 1947. These three boys were healthy, happy children
and we loved and enjoyed them. They kept us busy taking care of
them. September 13, 1948 we were blessed with a sweet little
girl, Lois Marie but how sad we were when we learned that she was
born with a heart problem. We took her to a specialist but they
could do nothing for here. She died January 31, 1949. Another
darling little girl, Rhonda Jean was born January 27, 1952. She
was a healthy, beautiful baby and so full of fun. Everyone loved
her. Our joy soon turned to sorrow as she took ill on October 30
and died November 2, 1952. I guess some of these special spirits
came to earth to get a body but if we are worthy we will be with
them again some day. We enjoyed our boys and did all we could to
make a good home for them.</p>

<p>My mother died June 25, 1956 at age 77. She was born in 1879.
We enjoyed camping or just going on a picnic on the mountain.
Each summer we came to Idaho to visit my family. We also took our
boys to the state and national parks and other interesting places.
As they grew older, they were a great help to us on the farm,
especially in the hay and potato harvest. Most of the families in
our town were active members of the church and in a small ward
everyone is kept busy. I taught classes in Primary, Sunday
school, M.I.A. and Relief Society. I was a counselor in the
Primary presidency for several years and then in Y.W.M.I.A. I was
the president of Young Women for several years. In 1950, I was
set apart as Relief Society President. I helped on many
committees for ward socials and prepared food for dinners and
parties. I was busy but enjoyed helping in all the ward
activities. Gus also held many positions in the ward. Pie worked
in the Sunday School and M.I.A. He was one of the seven
presidents of the seventies Quorum.</p>

<p>November 6, 1948, he was ordained a high Priest and set apart
as first counselor to Bishop Van Wiley. Then in August of 1953,
he was ordained and set apart as Bishop of the Antimony Ward.
After his release as Bishop, he was called into the Stake high
Council where he served for several years. June 15, 1962 Grandma
Twitchell died of cancer. She was a sweet lady and loved by all
who knew her.</p>

<p>Our son Dennis was married in September of 1963 and our second
son David was called to serve a mission in January 1964 to the
Northwestern States. Terry was called to serve in the South
California Mission in June 1966.</p>

<p>At this time the US was involved in the Vietnam War. David was
drafted so he joined the navy, He was in basic training the same
time Terry was finishing his mission in San Diego. California.
Terry came home in June 1968, and David had a military leave in
August. While he was on leave he and Nedra Hatch were married in
the St. George Temple.</p>

<p>After David was released from the navy he and Nedra returned
to college in Cedar City. Terry had transferred to Utah State in
Logan. Dennis was busy trucking and Gus and I were busy on the
farm. Things seemed to be going along nicely when Gus suffered a
heart attack in April 1970 and spent several days in the hospital.
He was unable to take care of the farm work so David came home to
help. In fact, he took over.</p>

<p>At 7 P. M. on July 15, 1970 Gus was sifting in his chair
reading the newspaper when he had a massive heart attack and died.
It was a great sorrow to all of us but I think it was his time to
go. We had a very nice funeral service and buried him in a
beautiful hard wood casket. He had many friends who sent cards
and flowers. David was a great help to me. He finished the farm
work and harvested the hay and grain. He also took over the farm
work the next summer. David and Nedra's first son Dale was born
September 7, 1970. Dermis and Linda had two boys aged five and
three. We loved and enjoyed them but Gus did not live to see our
other ten grandchildren. When Terry was attending school in
Logan, he met Diane Pettingill. They were married September 18,
1970 in the Salt Lake temple. I am sure that Gus was there with
us at the wedding.</p>

<p>The winter of 70 and 71 was long and lonesome for me. That
summer I went on a church history tour. We went to Radio City in
New York. We saw the Joseph Smith home and went to the scared
Grove, which is a spiritual experience. We enjoyed our visit to
Nauvoo and the Hill Cumorah pageant. This experience was good for
me and I felt better when I returned home.</p>

<p>My father passed away June 15, 1971 in St. George, at age 93.
He was buried in the Thomas Riverside Cemetery in Idaho.</p>

<p>David took care of the farm in 1971. In the spring of 1972, we
sold the place to Charlie Brindly and Van Wiley. It had been our
home for thirty years and we hated to part with it but we felt it
was the best thing to do. I was glad to be free of the
responsibility.</p>

<p>Dennis was busy driving truck. David went to Idaho to help my
brother Charles on his farm and Terry had finished college and
was working for the Forest service. My sister Mary and I went to
Parma in June to attend our family reunion. At this time I was
living in Neil Ipson&#146;s house in town. It was a nice little
home and I enjoyed living in it. I kept the lawn mowed and
watered Terry and Diane were in California working for the Forest
Service so I decided to spend Thanksgiving with them. I enjoyed
my visit with them. They came to Utah for Christmas and spent
some time with me as well as with Diane&#146;s family in
Kaysville. So the winter of &#145;72 passed.</p>

<p>In June of 1973, I went on a Temple tour to California and St.
George. Then in July I went on a tour to Canada to British
Columbia and Alberta. We saw lots of beautiful scenery and
enjoyed the tour. The group was not LDS so we did not go to the
Cardston Temple, but we did go and see it.</p>

<p>Immediately after I returned from my trip to Canada I drove to
Richfield and found an apartment. I spent two days cleaning then
moved the first of August. David and Nedra were visiting in
Koosharem so they helped me move. Dennis and Linda were living in
Richfield and I wanted to be near them. The first Sunday that I
went to church I met Clifton Rees. He was just finishing his <sub>2nd
</sub>term as mayor of Richfield. We became good friends and
enjoyed each other for a year. We were married September 14, 1974.
In October we received our call to the Canada Vancouver Mission.
We arrived in Vancouver January 25, 1975. Our first assignment
was Prince Rupert. We were there for six months. We were in
Victoria six months then Osoyoos six months. We did not have much
success teaching or baptizing here. There were hard feelings in
the branch and it was about to fall apart. The branch was
reorganized and Cliff was set apart as a counselor and by the
time we left in July they had it going quite smoothly. I helped
in the Relief Society. I guess that was our purpose for being
sent to this area. We enjoyed our mission and felt we had
accomplished some good in each area. We left the mission field
July 15, 1976. We had a nice trip home and received a nice
welcome We arrived in Salt Lake in a very heavy rainstorm. We
gave our report in our ward and were asked to speak in several
wards in the stake.</p>

<p>We had not been home too long when Cliff began having health
problems. He had two heart bypasses and died of congestive heart
failure November 2, 1977. There I was alone and lonesome again. I
spent Thanksgiving in Idaho with my family and Christmas in
Richfield with Dennis and Linda. I had always wanted to see the
Rose Parade so I made reservations with the James Tour Co. to go
to Pasadena for New Years to see the parade. Strange things
happen when you least expect them. Chariton Jacobs from Mt.
Pleasant, Utah was on that tour. I sat in the seat in front of
him and we talked and got acquainted. We stayed in Las Vegas that
night and the next day we sat together on the bus. We spent much
of our time together on the tour and enjoyed each other s company.
When we arrived home, we kept in touch and soon decided that we
wanted to get married. We were married April 12, 1978 in the
Manti Temple. He had a nice home in Mt. Pleasant and we spent 15½
happy years in it.</p>

<p>Chariton was named after his grandfather who was born on the
banks of the Chariton River soon after the saints were driven out
of Nauvoo. His family and friends called him Charry. He was born
and raised in Mt. Pleasant and attended Snow College and BYU. He
worked with his father as a mortician for many years and then by
himself after his father died. He retired and sold his business
soon after we were married. We went to Hawaii on our honeymoon
and had a great time.</p>

<p>We belonged to the fourth ward and my first church assignment
was Primary secretary. I was a visiting teacher for 15½ years. I
was called to be Compassionate Service Leader for three years. I
was invited to join the Fine Arts Club, which I enjoyed. It was
such a nice group of ladies and I loved all of them. There were
special occasions when we invited our husbands.</p>

<p>In 1979, Charry and I were called to the Washington Spokane
Mission. We spent nine months in Grand Coolee, three months in
Republic, and six months in Quincy. We had the privilege of going
to the dedication of the Seattle Temple. We enjoyed our eighteen
months in the mission field. We enjoyed working with the Elders
and the other couples. We worked with less active members and had
good success in helping them become active again. We also
encouraged parents who had children over eight years old to have
them baptized. We enjoyed our mission and felt we helped in some
areas. After we returned home, we decided to have a carport built.
This took some time and a lot of work but it was worth it. We
surely enjoyed having it. Mt. Pleasant City installed a sewer
system so of course we hooked up to that. On June 24, Charry and
I were set apart as ordinance workers in the Provo Temple. We
worked there for five years and enjoyed every day of it. Charry
said it was the highlight of his life. He enjoyed genealogy and
temple work. We also went to the Manti Temple quite often. Charry
and I had a very good marriage. We had the same interests and
enjoyed doing things together. We went on many church history and
temple tours. We also went to see other places of interest. In
fact we covered the whole United States and much of Canada. We
visited twenty temples. Charry had a very nice family and I was
accepted and made to feel like one of them. He had two daughters
and one son. He also had two brothers and a sister. We had family
reunions and spent many holidays and special occasions together.
Our home was a gathering place and we often had a house full but
they were always welcome. On the Sunday of October conference
1993, Charry&#146;s family all came to Mt. Pleasant. We had a
picnic lunch at the picnic area up by the power plant during the
noon break between conference sessions. We had such a nice time
together and Charry enjoyed it so much. After the afternoon
reunion, Annette took us for a ride around the Mt. Nebo scenic
loop. This was our last family gathering. At 10 P.M. Friday,
October 8, Charry had a very bad stroke. We took him to the
hospital in Provo where he passed away October 13, 1993. He was
in the hospital on his 81 birthday, October 10. Karen, Annette,
Dennis and I were with him when he died. We had a very nice
funeral service for him Saturday, October 16. He was buried in
the Mt. Pleasant cemetery next to his wife Fern McIntosh. I miss
him very much. He was a very kind, thoughtful man. After the
funeral my family all came to my home to visit and decide what
was best for me to do. I wanted to move to Idaho to be near David
and Terry. Dennis lived in Salt Lake, but I did not want to live
there. Terry and Diane knew of a nice little home in Shelley that
was for sale so we decided that I should buy the house and live
in Shelley. They went home and took care of all the business of
buying the house for me. I am so thankful for all they did for me.
A month after Charry died my brother Harper, who lived in Parma,
Idaho, passed away. My sister Mary and I planned to go on the bus
but Dennis helped us with the plane tickets so we flew. We were
happy to see many family members whom we had not seen for some
time.</p>

<p>When we returned, I stayed in Salt Lake until after
Thanksgiving, which we enjoyed at Mike and Sharon's s home. The
next day Dennis took me back to Mt. Pleasant. The business on the
house in Shelley was progressing and I had a lot of packing to do
so December was a busy month for me. I had my living room filled
with boxes and bags. I was invited to Salt Lake for Christmas and
I was getting ready to move so I did not make any preparations at
home. Gary came December 23 and took me to Salt Lake. The day
after Christmas, Dennis rented a big truck. David, Terry, Jeff
and a friend came to help me load the truck. Terry drove my car
back to Idaho. I rode with David in the U. Haul and his friend
drove his pick up. Annette and Dean and their boys and Karen came
to say goodbye. I said a tearful goodbye to my home in Mt.
Pleasant. I had lived there 15½ years and enjoyed it very much.
I arrived in Shelley and saw my new home for the first time. It
was a nice little house and I really liked it. I stayed with
Terry and Diane a few days until we got the truck unloaded and I
could start keeping house.</p>

<p>I moved into my house January 3, 1994 and enjoyed living there
until the fall of that year. A very nice senior citizen complex
had been completed on West Pine street. The apartments were very
nice so I decided to apply for one. Number 12 was still available
so I moved into it December 13, 1994. I had no trouble selling
the house so things worked very nicely for me. I see that I was
blessed in being able to make the move. It is a perfect situation
for me. I do not have to worry about doing yard work or making
house payments. The other tenants are very nice and we have some
fun times together. We have dinners in the community room and on
summer evening we sit out and enjoy visiting. The complex is
located in the Eighth Ward but my bishop gave me permission to
stay in the Fourth Ward since that is the ward Terry and Diane
belong to. I plan to live here the rest of my life but I cannot
see into the future.</p>

<p>I want my family to know how much I love them and all they
have done for me and are still doing. Terry and Diane are taking
good care of me and it is a comfort to know they are close by and
willing to help if I need it. I still enjoy good health and am
able to take care of myself.</p>

<p>I am thankful for the many blessings I have received during my
life. I am thankful for my membership in the church and the
feeling of security I have to know that I belong to the true
church. I know the Lord loves and watches over us. I love the
gospel and have a strong testimony.</p>
