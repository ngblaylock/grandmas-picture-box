		<P>Charles Alfred Harper Jr. was born of goodly pioneer parents while crossing the 
			plains in 1848. He was born July 23, 1848, at Fort Laramie, Wyoming. He was the 
			second son of Charles Alfred Harper Sr. and Lavina Wollerton Dilworth (from 
			Chester County Pennsylvania). Charles Sr. and Lavina moved to Nauvoo Illinois 
			in the year 1840.
			<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">Charles Jr. spent his boyhood days in Big Cottonwood, now 
			known as
			<st1:place w:st="on">
<st1:City w:st="on">Holladay</st1:City>, 
<st1:State w:st="on">Utah</st1:State></st1:place>. He loved horses and learned the black 
			smith trade. He helped his brothers herd cows and sheep in Parley's Canyon. 
			They also helped their mother take care of the family farm.
			<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">When Charles was eighteen years-old, he married Mary Boyes 
			(October 26, 1866, Sealed in the Endowment House August 22, 1870). She was the 
			daughter of George and Elizabeth Taylor Boyes. Charles and Mary's first son, 
			Charles Alfred, was born May 9, 1871 at Holladay
			<st1:State w:st="on">
				<st1:place w:st="on">Utah
			</st1:State>. He died January 23, 1872.
			<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">In the year of 1872, the family went to
			<st1:place w:st="on">Southern Utah</st1:place>
			to assist in pioneering. Their second son, George Boyes, was born December 1, 
			1872 at Levan,
			<st1:place w:st="on">
<st1:City w:st="on">Juab County</st1:City>, 
<st1:State w:st="on">Utah</st1:State></st1:place>. They remained only a short time before 
			returning to
			<st1:place w:st="on">Holladay</st1:place>.
			<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">Their second son, George Boyes, died September 14, 1886 at
			<st1:place w:st="on">
<st1:City w:st="on">Holladay</st1:City>, 
<st1:State w:st="on">Utah</st1:State></st1:place>. Their third child, Mary, was born 
			December 8, 1874 in
			<st1:place w:st="on">Holladay</st1:place>.
			<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">About this time the Church was establishing a settlement on 
			the Bear River in
			<st1:State w:st="on">Idaho</st1:State>
			and
			<st1:State w:st="on">
				<st1:place w:st="on">Utah
			</st1:State>. Charles' elder brother Harvey, and his family, had been called to 
			settle the town of
			<st1:City w:st="on">
				<st1:place w:st="on">Randolph
			</st1:City>. Charles took his wife and family and joined his brother in their 
			settlement. They had a thriving industry-a saw mill and shingle mill. Charles 
			and Mary's fourth child, Joseph Boyes, was born April 4, 1877, at
			<st1:place w:st="on">
<st1:City w:st="on">Randolph</st1:City>, 
<st1:State w:st="on">Utah</st1:State></st1:place>.
			<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">They returned to
			<st1:place w:st="on">Holladay</st1:place>
			in 1878, where Charles bought a fifty acre farm, or homestead. He worked to 
			bring it up to a high state of cultivation and prosperity. It was well cared 
			for and the buildings were all substantial and of modern architecture. Charles 
			lived here until his death.
			<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">The following children were born at the homestead in
			<st1:place w:st="on">Holladay</st1:place>: Lavina, their fifth child, March 3, 
			1879, Edwin B. was born June 15, 1881. John was born December 27, 1883. He died 
			February 13, 1884. William was born April 14, 1885. James was born June 14, 
			1887, and died the same day.
			<st1:City w:st="on">
				<st1:place w:st="on">Elizabeth</st1:place>
			</st1:City>
			was born May 28, 1890, and died June 2, 1891. Chester Aubrey was born May 14, 
			1893 and died the same day.
			<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">In the year 1890 Charles went on a mission to the
			<st1:place w:st="on">Sandwich Islands</st1:place>. He had to return on account 
			of the climate before his mission was finished.</P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">Charles and his boys were among the first to introduce the 
			threshing machine in the
			<st1:place w:st="on">
				<st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Salt</st1:PlaceName>
				<st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Lake</st1:PlaceType>
			</st1:place>
			valley. Their first machine was run by horse power. Later they used the steam 
			engine. They were known far and wide.
			<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">He was a member of the Democratic Party, to which Charles 
			Alfred Sr. also belonged. He had taken a prominent role in the affairs of the
			<st1:place w:st="on">
				<st1:PlaceName w:st="on">LDS</st1:PlaceName>
				<st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Church
			</st1:place>. Charles was the president of the quorum of elders, forty years. 
			He was also the president of the one-hundred and thirty-fourth Quorum of the 
			Seventies.
			<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">His wife, Mary, died on November 24, 1910. She was buried in 
			the
			<st1:place w:st="on">Holladay</st1:place>
			cemetery next to all of her children.
			<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">On April 14, 1911, Charles married his sister-in-law, Ann 
			Elizabeth Boyes Smith. They lived together for twenty years. No children were 
			born to this union. She died February 23, 1931. She was buried in the
			<st1:place w:st="on">Holladay</st1:place>
			cemetery.
			<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">Charles' wives were valuable members of the Relief Society in 
			the Big Cottonwood Ward. They were both Presidents for a long time. Mary 
			Harper, his first wife, was a school teacher. They were active in Primary. All 
			his sons and daughters were active in the Mutual Improvement Association,
			<st1:place w:st="on">
				<st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Sunday</st1:PlaceName>
				<st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Schools</st1:PlaceType>
			</st1:place>
			and other ward affairs. The Harper family is one of the most prominent in that 
			section of
			<st1:State w:st="on">Utah</st1:State>, and especially in the affairs of the
			<st1:place w:st="on">
				<st1:PlaceName w:st="on">LDS</st1:PlaceName>
				<st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Church
			</st1:place>. They have been intimately associated with the heads of the 
			Church, both through the paternal and maternal side of the family. The 
			prominent part which their immediate associations took in the development of
			<st1:place w:st="on">
				<st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Salt</st1:PlaceName>
				<st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Lake</st1:PlaceType>
				<st1:PlaceType w:st="on">County</st1:PlaceType>
			</st1:place>
			and in the building up of that section of the valley, have been carried on by 
			their descendants. Today, there is no more highly respected name in the
			<st1:PlaceName w:st="on">LDS</st1:PlaceName>
			<st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Church</st1:PlaceType>
			and in the Holladay wards of
