		<P><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Elizabeth Taylor was born in Hale, Westmoreland, 
<st1:country-region w:st="on">England</st1:country-region></ST1:PLACE>, on 
September 4th, 1819. Her father, James Taylor was the son of Edward Taylor and 
Elizabeth Saul of Haversham, 
<st1:place w:st="on">
<st1:City w:st="on">Westmoreland</st1:City>, 
<st1:country-region w:st="on">England</st1:country-region></st1:place>. Her mother, Agnes Taylor, 
was the daughter of John Taylor and Agnes Whittington of Thorn, 
<st1:place w:st="on">
<st1:City w:st="on">Westmoreland</st1:City>, 
<st1:country-region w:st="on">England</st1:country-region></st1:place>. She was the sixth of ten 
children, the second child in the family being John Taylor who later became the 
President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
<o:p></o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">
			<st1:City w:st="on">Elizabeth</st1:City>
			came to
			<st1:country-region w:st="on">
				<st1:place w:st="on">Canada</st1:place>
			</st1:country-region>
			with her parents in 1828 when she was nine years of age. She married William 
			Arrowsmith when she was twenty-one years old in 1840. He was a miller by trade 
			and some years later was drowned in his own mill race.
			<o:p></o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">Her first child, a son whom they named John after her older 
			brother, was born December 25, 1841, in Millersburg,
			<st1:place w:st="on">
<st1:City w:st="on">Mercer County</st1:City>, 
<st1:State w:st="on">Iowa</st1:State></st1:place>.
			<o:p></o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">She heard the gospel message and accepted it as the truth and 
			had an urgent desire to join the body of the saints. Her husband could not see 
			the truth of the gospel and he tried to prevent her from leaving as he loved 
			her very dearly. However,
			<st1:City w:st="on">
				<st1:place w:st="on">Elizabeth</st1:place>
			</st1:City>
			felt that no sacrifice was too great to make for the gospel and even though her 
			husband watched her rather closely she finally succeeded in leaving with her 
			two children. Her second child, a daughter whom she named Hannah had been born 
			in
			<st1:place w:st="on">
<st1:City w:st="on">Augusta</st1:City>, 
<st1:State w:st="on">Iowa</st1:State></st1:place>, on the 19th of September, 1844. Hannah 
			was taken ill and died November 4, 1846, just three months before another son, 
			James, was born on February 2, 1847, in Florence, Nebraska. This child lived 
			only until the 8th of May when he too died at the place of his birth.
			<o:p></o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">Elizabeth Taylor left Winter Quarters with the Parley P. Pratt 
			Company along with her parents and her brother, President John Taylor, and his 
			family. She married George Boyes on the trip westward and in spite of all the 
			trials and hardships she had endured she often remarked that she was as happy 
			as a lark feeling that she was doing the right thing. George Boyes was a 
			widower and a father of six children, some of whom were grown. They arrived in
			<st1:place w:st="on">
				<st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Salt</st1:PlaceName>
				<st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Lake</st1:PlaceType>
				<st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Valley</st1:PlaceType>
			</st1:place>
			on the 19th of September, 1847.
			<o:p></o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">For two years they lived in the fort and then built a home on 
			the property allotted to George Boyes on the northwest corner of 1st West and 
			2nd South. George purchased a forty acre farm in Big Cottonwood district from a 
			man named John Halladay. Here he built a small adobe house which was later used 
			as a granary after a larger home was erected.
			<o:p></o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">
			<st1:City w:st="on">
				<st1:place w:st="on">Elizabeth</st1:place>
			</st1:City>
			did not want to leave the city and go on a farm. Her health was not very good 
			and her parents were near her as well as her friends. Her first child after her 
			marriage to George Boyes was born in
			<st1:place w:st="on">
				<st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Salt</st1:PlaceName>
				<st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Lake</st1:PlaceType>
			</st1:place>
			on August 27, 1848, a little girl called Agnes, but she died in infancy. On May 
			12, 1850 she gave birth to twins, a boy Edward who died and Mary who lived to 
			become the mother of eleven children.
			<o:p></o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">One day as
			<st1:City w:st="on">
				<st1:place w:st="on">Elizabeth</st1:place>
			</st1:City>
			sat by her window, her son John, now a lad of about nine years was singing 
			"Come, Come Ye Saints." When he came to the words "how can I hope to gain a 
			great reward, if I now shun the fight," they struck
			<st1:City w:st="on">
				<st1:place w:st="on">Elizabeth</st1:place>
			</st1:City>
			with great force and she thought, "How can I hope to gain a great reward if I 
			do not go with my husband and make a home where he desires to be."
			<o:p></o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">When she told him she would go with him to the farm, he was 
			very pleased and as long as he lived he was kind and gentle with her. He would 
			quit his work any time to go find help for her when she was not strong enough 
			to do her own work.
			<o:p></o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">On February 26, 1852, she gave birth to a daughter Elizabeth 
			in Big Cottonwood. This daughter lived to be eighty-six years of age and became 
			the mother of 13 children.
			<o:p></o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">Her fifth child by this marriage, Sarah Leonora, was born in 
			the
			<st1:place w:st="on">
				<st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Salt</st1:PlaceName>
				<st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Lake</st1:PlaceType>
			</st1:place>
			home November 28, 1853. Two of her children passed away in early childhood, but 
			seven were reared to maturity.
			<o:p></o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">On October 25, 1855, a daughter, Rachel, was born but only 
			lived four and one-half years.
			<o:p></o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">George and Elizabeth were prospering and had built a larger 
			adobe home in which they were living when the Johnston Army scare came.
			<st1:City w:st="on">
				<st1:place w:st="on">Elizabeth</st1:place>
			</st1:City>
			was expecting another baby but never-the-less she was forced to leave her home 
			and seek a safer habitation. George dug a pit and such household effects as 
			they could not take with them were buried.
			<o:p></o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">On March 23, 1858, President Brigham Young attended a meeting 
			in Big Cottonwood. He advised the saints to go to
			<st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Beaver</st1:PlaceName>
			<st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Valley</st1:PlaceType>
			to begin homes again, but most of them got no further than the bottoms north of 
			the
			<st1:City w:st="on">
				<st1:place w:st="on">Provo</st1:place> R
			</st1:City>
			iver. The larger part of the Saints returned to their homes in the
			<st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Salt</st1:PlaceName>
			<st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Lake</st1:PlaceType>
			<st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Valley</st1:PlaceType>
			in July of 1858, but because of
			<st1:City w:st="on">
				<st1:place w:st="on">Elizabeth
			</st1:City>'s condition their family did not return until September. To their 
			great surprise they found on the farm a volunteer stand of grain ready to 
			harvest and over one thousand bushels were garnered. The granary was filled to 
			overflowing and the boys' room in the new house was also filled.
			<o:p></o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">
			<st1:City w:st="on">
				<st1:place w:st="on">Elizabeth
			</st1:City>'s baby, a little girl whom they named Ann, was born October 28, 
			1858. She became the mother of 11 children.
			<o:p></o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">Her next child, George, was born June 8, 1860 and died June 
			11, 1860, Joseph, her last child was born January 3, 1862. He had 12 children.
			<o:p></o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">In 1867 grasshoppers destroyed the crops.
			<st1:City w:st="on">
				<st1:place w:st="on">Elizabeth</st1:place>
			</st1:City>
			told of how they came the night before the 24th of July and ate everything 
			green in their path, but in spite of them the celebration planned for the 
			holiday was carried out. For the five years following, the crops were more or 
			less destroyed by these pests. Regardless of this condition in
			<st1:City w:st="on">
				<st1:place w:st="on">Elizabeth
			</st1:City>'s home they were never without flour.
			<o:p></o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">Even though
			<st1:City w:st="on">
				<st1:place w:st="on">Elizabeth</st1:place>
			</st1:City>
			was far from being a robust woman, she took her place in the community and did 
			her part in carrying on the work of the Lord. When the Relief Society was 
			organized in Big Cottonwood on May 3, 1868, she was sustained as treasurer. 
			June 15, 1870, she was made president of the Relief Society.
			<o:p></o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">On August 1, 1874, her husband passed away leaving her a widow 
			at 55 years of age. Her youngest child was twelve and on him fell the 
			responsibility of carrying on the farm under his mother's capable direction. 
			She owned a home in the city leased to her by her parents located on the site 
			where the Inter-Urban Railway station later stood and by adding four rooms to 
			this she rented the place for over $100.00 a month. She liked to visit the 
			city, and as long as she was able to travel, her son took her whenever she 
			desired to go. They tell that always on the trip home they had a pound of 
			hardtack which was usually consumed by the time the ten mile ride was ended. 
			She never lost her liking for hardtack and peppermints and the grandchildren 
			knew she could always be counted on to supply one or two from her big pockets 
			most anytime.
			<o:p></o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">In 1887 the Relief Society was reorganized and
			<st1:City w:st="on">
				<st1:place w:st="on">Elizabeth</st1:place>
			</st1:City>
			retired from the presidency and acted as first counselor until the end of 1900.
			<o:p></o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">Many tasks fell to the lot of pioneer women in the home. Flax 
			was raised on
			<st1:City w:st="on">
				<st1:place w:st="on">Elizabeth
			</st1:City>'s farm and thread was spun from it.
			<st1:City w:st="on">
				<st1:place w:st="on">Elizabeth
			</st1:City>'s daughters Elizabeth and Sarah Leonora did most of that spinning. 
			The girls made their own dresses and wore them until the skirt was thin at the 
			back, when back was turned to front and the dress used as a school dress, and a 
			new Sunday one made.
			<o:p></o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">
			<st1:City w:st="on">
				<st1:place w:st="on">Elizabeth</st1:place>
			</st1:City>
			was a splendid housekeeper and even though she directed much of the household 
			activity from her couch, it was carried out to her liking. The children each 
			had a nail for their clothes and in the evening before they retired their 
			clothes were hung on the nails with the shoes, heel touching the wall under 
			them. Before her daughters of hired help could sit down to a meal, the stove 
			must be in order as well as the work table and kitchen areas.
			<o:p></o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">Some of
			<st1:City w:st="on">
				<st1:place w:st="on">Elizabeth's dresses were made of heavily brocaded silk and were so stiff that 
			the full skirts could almost stand alone. She had quilted petticoats and a big 
			pocket which was tied around the waist and hung under the skirt. As long as she 
			lived, she wore a white net scarf around her neck and a white apron which 
			usually had deep lace on the bottom. She liked her children to have nice things 
			and loved to get them pieces of jewelry to wear. She was very hospitable and 
			entertained the authorities of the church and their wives a great deal when 
			they came to Big Cottonwood. Never a friend came in, that she did not send one 
			of the children out to get a pan of chips, and refreshments were served them.
			<o:p></o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">She enjoyed the brass band which the community boasted, and we 
			would dance down the path, when they stopped to play in front of the house, and 
			toss a dollar to them.
			<o:p></o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">With her own hands she helped plant many fruit and shade 
			trees, a number of which are still standing and bearing today.
			<o:p></o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">In her patriarchal blessing given December 12, 1847, by John 
			Smith, she was told that she should have sons and daughters excelled by none in
			<st1:country-region w:st="on">
				<st1:place w:st="on">Israel
			</st1:country-region>. Also that she should heal the sick by the prayer of 
			faith when no elder was present. Among her posterity are stake authorities, 
			ward authorities, many missionaries, educators, musicians, and many fine and 
			honorable people.
			<o:p></o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">Once, when she was quite poorly, Sisters Eliza R. Snow, Zina 
			Young, and Elizabeth Howard came to wash and anoint her, and during the 
			ceremony Sister Snow spoke in tongues and interpreted the same.
			<o:p></o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">During her life time she did a great deal of temple work both 
			in the
			<st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Logan</st1:PlaceName>
			<st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Temple</st1:PlaceType>
			and after its completion in the
			<st1:place w:st="on">
				<st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Salt</st1:PlaceName>
				<st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Lake</st1:PlaceType>
				<st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Temple
			</st1:place>.
			<o:p></o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">She loved her children and grandchildren very dearly and often 
			in her very old age when asked if the children annoyed her she would say, "Oh, 
			no, their noise is music to my ears." Almost as long as she lived Christmas was 
			an outstanding event as her posterity gathered at her home. She lived to be 
			almost ninety, passing away just a few days before her birthday. She died 
			August 31, 1909. She left six children, about fifty grandchildren and many 
			great-grandchildren to carry on her memory and bring honor to her name.
