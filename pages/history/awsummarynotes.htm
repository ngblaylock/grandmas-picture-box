		<P class="MsoNormal">Entered Valley 25 September 1847 in A. O. Smoot Company.</P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">He was born 11 November 1778 in Farmington, Connecticut, son 
			of Eldad Woodruff and Diana Woodruff. Wilford Woodruff, son of Aphek Woodruff, 
			says of his father, "My father married a second wife, Azubah Hart. She bore him 
			six children. He was a man of strong constitution and did a great amount of 
			labor. At eighteen years of age he began work in a flour mill and saw mill and 
			continued at his occupation there for about fifty years. Most of that time he 
			labored eighteen hours a day. He never made any profession of religion until I 
			baptized him into the Church of Jesus Christ on the first day of July, 1838. He 
			was a man of great charity, honesty, and integrity and made himself poor by 
			giving to the poor. He was liberal in accommodating his fellow men by lending 
			money and by becoming surety for his neighbors. He generally said yes to every 
			man who asked a favor at his hands." Aphek Woodruff died 20 May 1861 in Salt 
			Lake City.</P>
