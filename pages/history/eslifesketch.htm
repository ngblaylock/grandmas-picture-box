		<P class="MsoNormal">Eliza Spencer was born June 15, 1813, in Ohio in the town. She 
			was the first of Solomon and Martha Jones Spencer's children born in Ohio, and 
			one of a family of eight children.</P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">When Eliza was twelve years old her father died leaving his 
			family to provide for themselves. It was a new country and the people suffered 
			from malaria. She walked three miles to school and lived, meanwhile working for 
			her board,&nbsp;with a family who provided her a home.
			<o:p></o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">She had two sisters older than herself and one younger sister 
			who married a Sectarian minister; She joined the Mormons, after which he didn't 
			treat her very kindly. At the same time Eliza and her mother joined the church. 
			Eliza had three brothers who never did join the church and were very much 
			opposed to their mother and sister having done so.
			<o:p></o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">Eliza lived&nbsp;with the family of a convert named Jonathan 
			Taylor, who kept a hotel. While here she met Patriarch Smith, father of the 
			Prophet, who gave per a blessing. She went with this family to
			<st1:State w:st="on">Missouri</st1:State>
			but were not permitted to stay, and were driven to
			<st1:place w:st="on">
<st1:City w:st="on">Nauvoo</st1:City>, 
<st1:State w:st="on">Ill.</st1:State></st1:place>
			Here she went into the family of Louis Robbins to help his wife-and while here 
			a friend of the Robbins family, James Moses, came and met Eliza Spencer.
			<o:p></o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">James Moses was a widower with two small children which were 
			cared for by the Robbins family. A romance followed this meeting, and they were 
			married at the first Conference in Nauvoo, by Don Carlos Smith. They lived in 
			Nauvoo, and, here, four children were born to them. Three died, two boys and 
			one girl. After the expulsion from Nauvoo they lived for a number of years in
			<st1:State w:st="on">
				<st1:place w:st="on">Iowa</st1:place>
			</st1:State>
			where three more children were born.
			<o:p></o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">In 1853 the family moved to
			<st1:place w:st="on">
				<st1:City w:st="on">Canaen</st1:City>
				<st1:State w:st="on">Conn.</st1:State>
			</st1:place>
			where one more child, Fred, was born-making five living children. They lived on 
			the old Moses homestead, taking care of the old folks. After their death James 
			Moses decided to move West, and in the summer of 1861 the family started West.
			<o:p></o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">After a rather uneventful journey with its hardships, such as 
			having the children sick with the measles, and her husband laid up with an 
			infected foot, they arrived in
			<st1:place w:st="on">
				<st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Salt</st1:PlaceName>
				<st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Lake</st1:PlaceType>
				<st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Valley</st1:PlaceType>
			</st1:place>
			September 16, 1861.
			<o:p></o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">When she married James Moses and joined the Mormons she cut 
			herself off from her own family, who were Mormon opposers, but she bravely went 
			forward and never had the pleasure of meeting any of them again, with the 
			exception of one brother who was passing through
			<st1:City w:st="on">Salt Lake 
City</st1:City>
			on the way to
			<st1:State w:st="on">
				<st1:place w:st="on">Oregon
			</st1:State>. This was the last contact she ever had with any of her kin, and 
			it is not known by her children where any of them reside.
			<o:p></o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">She lived with her family in Cottonwood near
			<st1:place w:st="on">Cottonwood</st1:place>
			Bridge. She was actively engaged in Relief Society and other neighborhood 
			activities.
			<o:p></o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">The last two or three years of her life she was in poor health 
			and on December 15, 1874 she passed from this life, mourned by her family and a 
			large circle of friends and neighbors.
			<o:p></o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">The following winter after leaving Nauvoo they lived in Winter 
			Quarters Neb.
			<o:p></o:p></P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">She raised to manhood and womanhood five children:
