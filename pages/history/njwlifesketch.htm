<p>I was born on the 21 June 1919 at the family home in Hyde
Park, Cache County, Utah to Lola Everett Jorgensen who was the
son of Isaac Jorgensen and Rebecca Nielsen Jorgensen. His parents
were converts to the LDS church from Denmark. My mother was Maria
Elizabeth Waite Jorgensen, daughter of Levi Joseph Waite and
Maria Phoenix Waite whose parents were converts from England who
immigrated to the United States.</p>

<p>I was the ninth child in a family of ten children born to this
couple. I have five sisters and four brothers whose names are:
Venna, born 10 June 1905</p>

<p>Berdice, born 18 Nov 1907</p>

<p>Carlyn, born 5 Dec 1908</p>

<p>Lyda, born 16 Aug 1910</p>

<p>Arda, born 20 Jan 1913</p>

<p>Everett Waite, born 5 Mar 1914</p>

<p>Levi Harold, born 9 Feb 1916 (</p>

<p>Cleon Alverdo, born 14 Nov 1917</p>

<p>Myself and</p>

<p>Orlin Glen, born 21 Dec 1920, who died on 25 Jan 1921. </p>

<p>I was born on the longest day of the year which is also the
first day of summer and I am always teased about having to take
the longest day of the year to get here. My mother had a doctor
and midwife attend her at my birth. It was a nice summer day and
Aunt Annie Nielsen came to assist my mother.</p>

<p>My father's occupation was a farmer and he also did other
things besides. Most of his farm was dry farm and the rest under
irrigation. He also did Blacksmith work for people, and at one
time hauled milk to the creamery, with a horse and wagon. My
mother was a housewife and mother. We lived on the east side of
Hyde Park on a little hill overlooking the town. There was no one
else who lived above us and we were only about one mile from the
mountains. We had a view of the whole Cache Valley from where we
lived.</p>

<p>Many times I have walked to the mountains and part way up some
of them. We were also about one mile from the street car, church
and store and I have walked to these places many times. We didn't
have a car--only about twice that I can remember as I was growing
up so we either walked, rode a horse or went with horse and wagon.</p>

<p>I was blessed in the Hyde Park Ward Chapel, Cache County, </p>

<p>Utah by Joseph A. Hulmer and given the name of Norma. My first
playmates other than my brothers and sisters was a neighbor, Nona
Jensen, and Ada Balls. Nona was a couple of years younger than
me, and Ada was a schoolmate. Ada lived about five blocks from us
and south of the cemetery in Hyde Park which we had to pass to
and from town. &quot;lost of the girls my age lived in town and
so I did not become very close to any of them. I was always
backward and shy and did not make friends too easily. Many kids
used to make fun of me and that made me worse about making
friends. </p>

<p>I started school when I was six years of age. I had the same
teacher for first and second grade by the name of Mary Ann Grant.
We didn't have kindergarten in those days. We had to learn the
ABC's before we could learn to read anything. I learned how to
write and do simple arithmetic in these grades. We learned how to
spell &quot;cat, hat, rat,&quot; and simple words, then on to
more difficult things. I remember we had a big sandbox in the
room to play in at rest time. It was an oblong box quite big I
thought and stood on legs so we could stand at it to make things
in the sand. One day when I was in the second grade I was talking
and the teacher hit the desk in back of me with a ruler or
yardstick and about scared me to death, so I quit talking and she
cured me as I was afraid she might hit me the next time. I didn't
talk much after that.</p>

<p>The third and fourth grades I had Mae Perkes for a teacher and
in these grades were taught art besides other subjects and we had
more difficult lessons to do. We learned to make designs on paper
by using different size blocks and paints. The blocks were dipped
into paint and then pressed on paper to make designs. We also
learned to make Valentines and such. One year I made a Valentine
and trimmed it with white paper lace and gave it to Orlo Jensen
for a valentine and because we weren&#146;t supposed to fancy
them up that way that time, he pulled all the lace off of it and
I was pretty disgusted with him for that. I thought he had ruined
it after I had gone to all that work and thought it was so fancy.</p>

<p>Ada Balls and some other girls did a lot of talking when we
were in the fourth grade and they would say something to me,
about the time the teacher would see, and she thought I was doing
all the talking and I got the blame for what they were doing. The
teacher was going to keep me back another year because of it. The
next year Mr. Seamons called my name in his class and so mother
sent one of my sisters to see about it and they let me go ahead
on a trial basis.</p>

<p>The next two years for fifth and sixth grade I had Bishop J. W.
Seamons for a teacher. The lessons were more difficult during
these years but I did well so I could go ahead. We had singing
added to the other subjects we had. Then in the seventh and
eighth grade R. Homer Hyde was my teacher and I liked him best of
all the teachers. He was very strict but a good teacher. We would
have spelling bees in this class and I got to be a pretty good
speller. We also had penmanship tests to help us improve our
writing. We would have to write one certain word as many times as
we could and as many as we could in a certain length of time and
then we were graded on it. We also learned to write with ink and
pen. I had to memorize many poems and some of them were long ones
too. We were graded on hygiene all through school so had to be
neat and clean also. We would have recess in the morning and
afternoon to rest and play. We would play hopscotch, jump the
rope, swing or whatever we wanted to do. In winter some kids
would go out and play in the snow and others would stay inside.</p>

<p>In the winter when I would get to school my hands and feet
would be so cold I would cry and so the teacher would send me to
the rest -room to put cold water on my hands to try and warm them
up. I had to walk seven blocks to school and the snow was pretty
deep when I was a kid. Sometimes we could walk on top of the snow
when it was really cold and the snow was crusted over. Sometimes
it would snow and drift the roads full until I couldn't get to
school until dad plowed the road out. Sometimes he would take us
in a sleigh with the horses and sleigh. The snow would be quite
deep and piled high along the roads where it was plowed out. As
the years have passed there has been less and less snow until now
we don't have very much.</p>

<p>I used to enjoy playing in the snow as a youngster unless it
was too cold and then I would rather stay indoors. We used to lay
in the snow and move our arms up and down to make it look like
angel wings and thought it was great fun. Sometimes we would ride
the sleigh to school in winter, a hand sleigh. Levi and Cleon
would make me ride with them and as we would go quite fast down
the hill I did not like to ride from the top. I would get scared
and they would make me get on second and then I would try to drag
my feet to slow us down so Cleon would hold my feet up with his
and then we would go so fast that it would take my breath away.
If I could get half way down the hill before they caught up to me
then I didn't mind it so much but they didn&#146;t like that. I
was always afraid we wouldn't make all the turns and if we didn't
we would have run into a fence. I didn't mind coasting down small
hills or from half way down the hill because you couldn't go
quite so fast.</p>

<p>When in about the third or fourth grade Cleon and I would walk
to school- some of the time and we would play and dawdle on the
road so we were late and when we came in view of the school Mr.
Hyde could see us so he would stick his head out of the window
and yell at us, &quot;Get in here pronto&quot; and then we would
run the rest of the way into the school house. Cleon and I were
in the same grade because he was held back one year from about
the third grade on. We went to grade school until we graduated
from the eighth grade then we went to high school and didn't go
to junior hi-h. When I was supposed to go high school there were
four of us to go and as dad didn't have much money he said if he
could get us all into school the first day we could all go and he
wasn't able to do so and so Levi and Everett got to go and Cleon
and I stayed at home. Everett graduated and so the next year due
to the fact that there were still three of us to go Levi and
Cleon got to go. I was to stay home another year but a man from
the school board kept coming around and insisted I go. They said
I could earn my tuition fee to go. I had already missed a quarter
of school by then. I earned my way all the way through high
school with the exception of the last year when they stopped me
from working before I was through earning the full fee. I went to
North Cache High School. I attended for three and three fourth
years but I didn't graduate because I didn't make up the other
quarter of school.</p>

<p>I broke my glass lens by dropping them one day and hadn't been
able to get anymore so I quit going to school and went out to
work to get some new ones. I worked at school for three years in
the cafeteria and then I worked one year in the principals office.
I made up the seminary I had missed and graduated from there. The
high school teacher that made the biggest impression on me was Mr.
Elijah M. Hicken, my seminary teacher. Of all my school teachers,
the one I didn't like very much was my third and fourth grade
teacher Mae Perkes. </p>

<p>I took sewing one year in school and we couldn't afford to buy
all the material I was supposed to make up so I only made one
article for myself which was a dress. We were supposed to make
three articles. The rest of the time I sewed dresses for Arleen,
my sister Carlyn's daughter. The teacher was not too happy about
this so I never took it again. When I couldn't get into a sewing
class I took cooking. I didn't like the class although I took
three years of it in school. I also took shorthand and typing in
school and one year of bookkeeping but I could not get enough
speed to be able to get a job doing secretarial work, only to
type for myself and I did not have enough shorthand to learn it
that good, but I liked shorthand what I took of it. </p>

<p>The first Christmas that I can remember about was when I got a
set of little tin dishes with pictures painted on them. I
remember I was very thrilled about them so I took them upstairs
where my big sisters were still in bed to show them what I had
received, but the7 didn't seem too thrilled about them. By then
they were too big to be thinking about Santa Claus. One year I
got a big doll for Christmas. It was made with a cloth body and
the head, arms, and legs were of plaster parts or whatever they
made them out of in those days. The hair was painted on its head
and it was dressed in a pink dress and bonnet with white shoes on
its feet and stockings. I had this doll for quite awhile. That
was the last and only doll I remember getting. I may have had one
before this but I don't remember about one. I played with this
doll for quite a few years and then one arm came off. When Roma
Jean, the oldest grandchild of my parents was born my mother made
an arm for the doll and gave it to Roma Jean and I was very
unhappy about this.</p>

<p>The only other doll I remember was a little china doll about
two or three inches high, whose arms moved but that was all. I
would take scraps of cloth and make clothes for this doll. My
friend Nona Jensen had one too and we would play with them for
hours and make clothes for them to wear. One day they let Roma
Jean play with it and she broke the head off so I tied the head
on with a piece of cloth so I could play with it. I think I was a
little resentful of Roma Jean because they let her play with
everything I had or so it seemed. We would take the catalog and
cut out pictures of people and then make furniture out of paper
or cardboard to use to have for paper dolls and play with them
for hours. This was the way we amused ourselves as we were too
poor to buy such things in those days.</p>

<p>I remember when the depression was on. We were too poor to
have anything for Christmas but a little candy, nuts and maybe an
orange. We always had a Christmas tree though. My brothers would
go up to the mountains and cut a tree for us. It was always a
fresh tree and not one that had been cut for months like the ones
today. We had some colored rope to trim the tree and would string
popcorn to string on the trees and maybe we would have paper
chains that we had made in school or elsewhere to string on the
tree. As we did not have electricity when I was young we would
have little candles which fit into little candle holders that we
would clip on the tree. We would have to be careful how these
were placed so they would not set the tree on fire. After we got
electricity we finally bought a string of electric lights to put
on the tree.</p>

<p>I remember that Bishop Seamons always had what they called a
community Christmas tree each year. They would have a tree set up
in the recreation hall and there was candy, nuts and a small
present for everyone. I remember all the kids my age one year
received a covered hanger. All the age groups would usually get
the same thing. (that is everyone the same age.) We usually
looked forward to these every year. The primary would have Santa
Claus for the Primary children every year. We would usually get
candy and nuts there. Also at school the kids would draw names
and have to buy a small gift for the one whose name he had drawn.
We would have a program and exchange gifts.</p>

<p>One year when Carlyn was living with us after her husband had
died, she hung up my stocking and filled it with candy and nuts.
They did this so Arleen wouldn't think it funny that Santa
visited her and not me. It was my dirty stocking and I didn't
think it was very nice. Many times I only got what my sisters
gave me for Christmas, for my parents were too poor to buy
anything for us. One year I received a handkerchief from Venna
that she had made and Lyda gave me a little purse and boy did I
think I was smart carrying them around. I was very thrilled with
them. Also one year I got a dime and I don't remember what else
if anything and I thought I was very lucky to get that. I also
remember one year I got a piece of material for a dress. </p>

<p>When I was quite small I remember about Sarah Daines store
burning down. It was after dark when we were all in bed when we
heard the fire engine coming. I got frightened with the noise and
dad came and looked out the upstairs window to see if he could
tell where it was, for it looked like it was near where our
grandmother lived. Dad went to town to find out where it was. He
discovered it was just a half a block from grandma I s place.
Arda was staying with grandma that night and neither one of them
had heard the fire engine at all. I was so frightened by it all
and shivered and shook so my big sisters let me get in bed with
them.</p>

<p>I remember mother would send me down to grandma's house for
different things. Several times I would be sent down with a cup
of custard mother had made for her. She really wasn't our
grandmother. She was an aunt of my mothers but this aunt had
raised mother so we all called her &quot;grandma. I remember
visiting her all the time until she died. I was about nine or ten
at the time. I remember how bad my mother felt when grandmother
died. She was the only mother my mother had known. I also
remember my father's mother--Grandmother Jorgensen. We would go
and visit her quite often when we went to Logan. Every spring- I
would break out with a rash and had to stay out of school for a
couple of weeks, so one time grandmother Jorgensen told me to
take soda with the juice of a lemon to kill the taste of the soda
that I took for this problem. One time in school we were learning
to write letters. We were supposed to write a letter to someone
to learn how to write a letter properly, so I chose to write to
Grandma Jorgensen and invite her to come and visit us. She was
thoughtful enough to answer my letter and I still have it and
prize it dearly.</p>

<p>I remember Grandfather Jorgensen too. I remember him best
because he lived until I was a teenager in high school. One time
I was working in Logan for a couple of weeks and so I went and
visited with him and it was fun talking to him. I wanted him to
tell me something about his life. He told me he would help me,
but I never went back for another visit. I have been sorry ever
since. I never knew my Waite grandparents as they died when my
mother was small. I don't remember anything about Grandmother
Ridgeways husband either.</p>

<p>I vaguely remember when I was very small being in Dayton,
Idaho with my mother, probably when she went to see her brother
John Waite. I don't remember anything about it just being there.
I do remember crossing a little bridge with water running
underneath.</p>

<p>I was taught responsibility as soon as I was able to do things.
As I grew older I was given more and more to do. I ran a lot of
errands for mother. Many times I would go to the store with eggs
and bring home groceries for her. She taught me how to clean
house, wash, iron, cook, sew and do handwork such as embroidery
and crochet. We lived one mile away from the store. </p>
