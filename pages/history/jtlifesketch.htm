		<P>James Taylor was the last child born to Edward Taylor, and his second wife 
			Elizabeth Saul. His father married had his first wife, Jane Noble, when they 
			were both 24 years-old. They had five children, two sons and three daughters. 
			They were married for 17 years before Jane died at age 41.</P>
		<P class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Edward then married Elizabeth Saul 
			when he was 45, and she was 39 years old. Edward and Elizabeth had three 
			daughters; Mary, Jane, and Agnes. Unfortunately Edward died after five years of 
			marriage, at the age of 50. Elizabeth was three months pregnant with their 
			fourth child, a son. At that time she was 43 years-old. James was the baby she 
			was carrying at her husband's death. Elizabeth died 18 years later at the age 
			of 61, when James was 17 years old.</P>
		<P class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">At the time of Edward Taylor's 
			death, the English law of primogeniture was in effect. That meant the oldest 
			son took the estate and left the younger branches of the family to provide for 
			themselves as best they could. Because James was the youngest son, and he had 
			two older half-brothers, he did not receive any of his father's estate. He was, 
			however, able to get a good English education and became proficient in the 
			Latin and Greek languages. He also excelled in the higher branches of 
			mathematics.</P>
		<P class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">His father's great-uncle William 
			T. Moon, brother to James' grandmother Ann Moon, tried to make up for the 
			sudden death of James' father, which left him without an inheritance. He 
			bequeathed to James a small estate in Hale, Westmoreland.</P>
		<P class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">James met and later married Agnes 
			Taylor on 23 December 1805. Agnes' maiden name was the same as James', however, 
			as far as we have determined she was not related to him. Born to James and 
			Agnes were eleven children, nine sons and two daughters. They were as follows:</P>

		<P class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Notice how they gave the same name 
			to several of their children. It was common practice in those days to give the 
			same name of a sibling, who had died, to another younger child born after the 
			older sibling's death.</P>
		<P class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">James received an appointment 
			under the government in the Excise department, which deals with taxes. That job 
			required him to move from place to place. In 1819 he left the government 
			employment at
			<st1:place w:st="on">Liverpool</st1:place>, where he had lived for five years. 
			He moved his family to the estate he inherited in Hale,
			<st1:place w:st="on">
<st1:City w:st="on">Westmoreland</st1:City>, 
<st1:country-region w:st="on">England</st1:country-region></st1:place>.</P>
		<P class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">In 1830, at the age of 47, James 
			again moved his family, this time to
			<st1:State w:st="on">Ontario</st1:State>
			in
			<st1:State w:st="on">
				<st1:place w:st="on">Upper Canada</st1:place>
			</st1:State>, leaving behind his oldest living son, John, who was to settle the 
			affairs of the estate. (John later became our 2nd great grandfather.) About two 
			years later John was able to complete the business, and he followed the family 
			to
			<st1:country-region w:st="on">
				<st1:place w:st="on">Canada
			</st1:country-region>. While in
			<st1:State w:st="on">
				<st1:place w:st="on">Ontario
			</st1:State>, Elder Parley P. Pratt visited John and his wife Leonora Cannon, 
			and taught them the gospel. John gathered some investigators together, and in 
			the spring of 1836 John, Leonora, and most of James' family were baptized into 
			the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Two years later James' entire 
			family moved to
			<st1:place w:st="on">
<st1:City w:st="on">Far West</st1:City>, 
<st1:State w:st="on">Missouri</st1:State></st1:place>
			to be closer with the Saints.</P>
		<P class="MsoNormal" style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">James and his family endured all 
			the hardships the rest of the Saints did during the early history of the 
			Church. He was 63 years old when they left Nauvoo in the harsh winter of 1846. 
			A year later at the age of 64, he walked crossed the plains to
			<st1:City w:st="on">
				<st1:place w:st="on">Salt Lake City
			</st1:City>. James stayed faithful to the Church his entire life, and died at 
			the age of 87.</P>
