		<p>On a cold winter day in the little town of Dayton, Idaho, (also known as Five 
			Mile Creek when first settled) a little baby girl was born on the 18th December 
			1884 to Levi Joseph and Maria Phoenix Waite. She was the sixth child in a 
			family of seven children to be born to this couple. There were four girls and 
			three boys. Her sisters and brothers were: John William Waite born 21 March 
			1875 in Hyde Park, Cache County, Utah; Sarah Ann Waite born 2 December 1876 in 
			Dayton, Franklin County, Idaho and who dies 22 December 1876 at Dayton, Idaho; 
			Mary Jane Waite born 29<sup>th</sup> January 1878 at Dayton, Idaho; Emily Sears 
			Waite born 30 September 1879 at Dayton, Idaho; Levi Joseph Waite, Jr. born 13 
			August 1882 at Dayton, Idaho; and Joseph Waite born 6 October 1886 at Dayton, 
			Idaho and who died 29 February 1887 at Dayton, Idaho and who is buried in the 
			Hyde Park, Utah Cemetery.</p>
		<p>When Maria Elizabeth's mother died at the time when the last baby Joseph was 
			born, and Lizzie (as she was called) was only 2 years old at the time so her 
			father took her and her baby brother to Hyde Park to be cared for by her Aunt 
			Mary Ann Phoenix. Ridgeway. Her father was afraid she might get lost or someone 
			might steal her, or the Indians might take her. Her Aunt raised her as if she 
			were her own daughter and she never returned to live with her father. She 
			always called her Aunt Mary Ann her "Mother."</p>
		<p>Her father married again in November 1897 to Hannah Mickelsen. To this marriage 
			was born three girls and two boys, whose names are: Rachel Ada Waite born 4 
			December 1888 at Dayton, Idaho; Martha Ann Waite born 8 March 1891 at Dayton, 
			Idaho; Minnie Lavinia Waite born 14 March 1893 at Dayton, Idaho; George Moroni 
			Waite born 20 May 1895 at Dayton, Idaho and Jesse Orval Waite born 22 August 
			1897 and who died 17 May 1898 at Dayton, Idaho. These were her half-brothers 
			and sisters.</p>
		<p>When Maria Elizabeth was taken to Hyde Park, Utah, she had not been blessed. An 
			Uncle Joseph Waite blessed her and she was given the names of Maria Elizabeth 
			Waite in the Hyde Park ward in Cache County, Utah. She attended church in Hyde 
			Park. She also attended school in Hyde Park starting at the age of about seven, 
			going until she was 14 years of age. She went to school in a rock building in 
			the West part of town, which building later became the station for the street 
			car, and is now torn down. She also went to school in a building North of the 
			other one.</p>
		<p>Upon reaching the age of eight, she was&nbsp;baptized in a Spring west of Hyde 
			Park town on 25 January 1893 by Niels Christensen. When she was a child she 
			kicked the cat for some reason and when her mother cooked a rabbit after this 
			had happened her mother told her it was the cat she had cooked and Elizabeth 
			was never able to eat rabbit for some time after that.</p>
		<p>At age 14 after she finished school, she went out and worked for people cleaning 
			house and tending children if the people she worked for had children. She 
			received 70 cents a week at first and then later she got $1.50 a week.</p>
		<p>In those days they scrubbed floors on their hands and knees with a scrub brush 
			and washed with a tin tub and scrubbed them on a scrub board by hand. Most 
			people in those days had to go outside to the toilet, pack water in and heat it 
			to wash and bathe with and then carry the water back outside again. They also 
			ironed with flat irons heated on the stove. The stove was a coal or wood stove, 
			mostly wood, and the wood had to be carried into the house to make a fire with 
			and then the ashes had to be carried outside.</p>
		<p>Her Father passed away when she was 14 years of age from Typhoid fever. She 
			never went when they settled up the estate to see if there was anything for the 
			children. She didn't want to cross the State line into Idaho. She attended many 
			dances when she was a young girl and was very popular. She would dance until 
			the bustle she wore, was wet with perspiration then go outside and wring it 
			out, then go back to dancing again. A Bustle was a flounce like thing or ruffle 
			on the back of the dress at the waist or hip line. At about 16 years of age she 
			met a young man who had moved to Hyde Park and lived a half block across the 
			street from them by the name of Lola Everett Jorgensen, 19 years of age. They 
			became interested in each other and a courtship began which finally ended in 
			marriage.</p>
		<p>They set a date for 16 March 1904 and Lola took his bride to the Temple in 
			Logan, Cache County, Utah to be married for time and all eternity. They drove 
			to the Temple in a buggy with one black horse and one white horse. The day was 
			a beautiful sunshiny day but there was still much mud on the ground. They came 
			back to Hyde Park to live and took up house keeping in a little house across 
			the street from where her mother lived.</p>
		<p>The following year a little baby daughter came to bless their home and they gave 
			her the name of Venna. This baby was born on the 10 June 1905. When the baby 
			was three months old, Lola was called to go on a mission to Denmark. He left 
			leaving his wife and baby at home to wait for him. She wrote to him while he 
			was gone and waited faithfully for him to come home.</p>
		<p>Lola was released in 1906 before his mission was completely finished because of 
			ill health. He returned home to resume married life. On 18 November 1907 
			another daughter came to bless their home and they gave her the name Berdice. 
			The following year another daughter was born to them on the 5 December 1908, 
			and they named her Carlyn.</p>
		<p>After this daughter was born, Lola bought some land from his father East of Hyde 
			Park, to see if it would improve his health. This land was mostly dry farm with 
			a little that was under irrigation. Here he built a home for his family and 
			moved there to live. They took up farming to support their growing family.</p>
		<p>On August 16, 1910, another daughter was born to them and they chose Lyda for 
			her name. They had another daughter born to them on 20 January 1913 and they 
			named her Arda. By this time they were wondering if they would have any boys 
			and the little girls were hoping for a brother. Then on 5 March l914 a little 
			boy was born to them and they named him Everett Waite. The girls were very 
			happy to have a brother and Lola and Lizzie were happy to finally get a son. 
			They had two more boys born to them named Levi Harold Born 9 February l916 and 
			Cleon Alverdo born on 14 November 1917.</p>
		<p>About the year 1917 or 1918 World War I, broke out and in the winter of 
			1918-1919 there was a bad flu. epidemic and everyone was getting sick. It was a 
			ban time and many people died from it. All the family got the flu and when Lola 
			finally got it also, his sister Alvaretta came to help take care of them. 
			Lizzie was very ill with a fever of 105 degrees, and being pregnant at the time 
			with her 9th child they feared she would not pull through. Even though she was 
			very ill herself, she worried about other people and how they were getting 
			along.</p>
		<p>The family finally recovered from the flu and on 21 June 1919 she had another 
			daughter born to her, named Norma. She had one more baby born to her, a son 
			they named Orlin Glenn, Born 21 December 1920, but he was not to stay with them 
			very long and died on 25 January 1921. Before this baby died, she saw her 
			mother in a dream or something, standing at the end of a path and after the 
			baby died she decided her mother had come to take him with her.</p>
		<p>Lizzie was kept very busy with taking care of her young family, keeping house 
			and cooking for them. She was a very neat housekeeper and wanted things to be 
			neat and clean and taught her children to do the same. Also to be neat and 
			clean in their appearance. She also taught her girls to cook, sew, crochet and 
			do embroidery. The girls had to do work on the farm as there were no boys to 
			help until later years.</p>
		<p>She was a very thrifty woman and tried not to waste anything. She used every 
			thing that was useable. Lola would buy bolts of material and bring home and she 
			would make their clothes for the children and the scraps that were left she 
			used to make quilts. When the clothes wore out she took the good pieces and 
			used to make rugs for her floor. She made woven and braided rugs, sometimes 
			crocheted rugs.</p>
		<p>She taught her children to be mindful of their parents and to respect them. Also 
			to respect their brothers and sisters and other people and their elders. To be 
			honest and trustworthy in all their dealings with their fellow men.</p>
		<p>There were many hardships in her life. She had to wash clothes on a scrub board 
			in a tin tub until she got a hand crank washing machine, and then Lola bought 
			her a machine with a gas powered motor that had to be cranked by foot and this 
			job usually fell to her daughter Lyda who usually wore out her right shoe. This 
			was when Lyda was a teenager. The water would have to be packed into the house 
			from the outside hydrant and heated in a boiler on the stove and then put in 
			the washer. She also boiled her white clothes in the boiler on top of the cook 
			stove to get them white and then rinse them out before hanging out. She liked 
			clean clothes, even if they were patched. There was never any electricity in 
			the house until the year about 1932 and then she and three other families had 
			to take an electric stove to get the electricity put in their homes. They 
			weren't able to keep up the payments on the stove, so had to return it. The man 
			said her stove was the best taken care of, better than any of the others he had 
			returned to him.</p>
		<p>After they got electricity they had the washer converted to electricity, which 
			made it better for her. There never was plumbing in the house as long as they 
			lived there. They had to go outside to the toilet and when bathing time came, 
			pack water in the house and heat it on the cook stove, and then use the tin 
			wash tub to bathe in and then carry the tubs outside to dump the water out. 
			There was a room made for a bath room and one for a pantry and they took out 
			the partition between and made it all into a kitchen and built cupboards in 
			there, which was a big help.</p>
		<p>Lizzie spent many hours working in the garden growing vegetables and fruits to 
			feed her family and many hours canning them for winter. There was an outdoor 
			cellar where their vegetables and fruit were stored. This was dug down in the 
			ground with a top on it. She used this until Lola built a porch on the North 
			and East side of the house, then there was a cellar built under one room of the 
			house entered through the porch. They also stored apples, potatoes, and carrots 
			in the cellar for winter. This was more convenient for her as she didn't have 
			to go outside to get the things she needed.</p>
		<p>Around 1925 Lola had his leg broke for the second time and had to spend time in 
			bed. Lizzie had to see that things were taken care of with the help of the 
			children. She milked many cows in her lifetime and was very good at it. She and 
			her daughters would cook for the threshing men when they came to do the 
			threshing. Lizzie would spend many evenings reading books to her family. She 
			was a good reader and the children enjoyed listening to her. She read many good 
			books to them and this was a lot of their entertainment. There were few 
			luxuries in their life and she tried to get along with what they had and rarely 
			complained about her lack of them.</p>
		<p>Lola had an apple orchard and had a variety of apples. There was Dutch, Wealthy, 
			a Green Variety, Jonathan, Crab Apple, and a very good Snow apple. He also had 
			a pear, peach, apricot, cherry and some plum trees. Lola's sisters would come 
			and spend a couple of days and they with Lizzie would peel apples and dry them 
			for winter for all of them to have. They also dried corn for winter use. They 
			had an apple peeler and the bids helped to run it.</p>
		<p>When Lola killed a pig, she would make head cheese from the head and render the 
			lard to use for cooking and what she couldn't use for cooking, she rendered out 
			to make soap for washing. If she wanted to keep the ham and bacon awhile, she 
			would make a brine and store it in to cure it. She used everything she could 
			and not waste anything. The only time they had much meat, was when they killed 
			a beef, sheep or pig and later in life was able to buy meat.</p>
		<p>When they sheared the sheep she would spend hours washing the wool and drying 
			it, then she would have her children card it into little bats to use in her 
			quilts, laying them side by side on the quilt lining and then put on the top 
			and quilt them. She finally sent the wool to Logan and had bats made to fit the 
			quilt.</p>
		<p>When the depression was on in the 1930's, they didn't have much to get alone on 
			but she managed to see that her family was fed and clothed, although it wasn't 
			much. Many a time she fed her children sweet soup which was made of prunes and 
			raisins, cooked and thickened with sego. Red mush was made with red fruit juice 
			and thickened with sego. She sometimes made gruel from rolled oats which was a 
			thin mush, also flour mush which was made of scalded milk and flour with 
			cinnamon and sugar on it.</p>
		<p>The children were glad to get this to eat. She made soup lots of times with no 
			meat. She baked potatoes and beans. She always grew a garden to help feed her 
			family. They also had vegetables.</p>
		<p>She was very independent and wouldn't ask anyone for help unless it was 
			absolutely necessary. The Relief Society sent a quilt home one day with her son 
			Everett and she was very put out about it as she didn't think that she was that 
			bad off to need help. The people were asked to do work for the church welfare 
			for which they received a slip of paper that they could turn in and get 
			groceries or clothes if they needed them. I don't recall her ever turning in 
			any of the slips. She didn't class herself as being that needy.</p>
		<p>She always tried to grow some flowers to help beautify her home inside and 
			outside. She has hoed and thinned sugar beets as well as top them when 
			necessary. She picked beans for a neighbor and grew beans one year for the 
			factory and picked many of them. Lola bought her a pressure cooker and she 
			helped some other people can beans and done it for nothing and one lady didn't 
			even thank her. She also canned her own.</p>
		<p>Her husband was interested in Scouting and was a Scout leader. He would take 
			boys to White Pine Lake and Tony Grove Lake on horses with pack horses food and 
			bedding that they needed for an outing of one or two weeks. the 
			responsibilities to Lizzie to see that things were taken care of. Later Lola 
			went to Lenrose, Idaho for a few years to dig beets for a Mr. Hensen's in the 
			fall. a Year or two he took her with him and they had to live in a tent, and 
			Mr. Hensen let them live in his basement because he thought living in a tent 
			was too hard on her.</p>
		<p>She lived up Logan canyon a few years while Lola took care of cattle there. They 
			spent one year taking care of J. W. D. Hurren and wife. She would go to the 
			homes of her married daughters and help them when they were ill and needed 
			help. She and her older daughter took care of her Aunt or Mother as she called 
			her, when her Mother wasn't able to stay alone all the time. She would make 
			treats to send to her Mother to eat, like custards and etc. The older girls 
			stayed nights with grandmother Ridgeway.</p>
		<p>She had much faith in the Lord and a strong testimony of the gospel. When her 
			daughter Lyda was very ill as a child with Brights Disease, as it was called 
			then, the Doctor said he had done all he could do. She never gave up hope. They 
			called in the Elders to come and administer to Lyda and pray for her and she 
			was healed through the power of faith.</p>
		<p>When her son-in-law, Weldon Potts was ill, one day she laid down to rest and she 
			saw him standing at the front gate and upon arising she told Lola and said some 
			thing was wrong so they immediately went to Smithfield and found out that he 
			had died from a ruptured appendix. She lived so that she was prompted by the 
			Holy Ghost. She believed in paying an honest tithing and her church dues and 
			did so up to the end of her life. She always believed in being honest and set a 
			good example for her children to follow. She never forgot to thank the Lord for 
			all the blessings she received.</p>
		<p>She and Lola did much temple work and when they were going to the temple, would 
			spend an hour or two pressing the temple clothes so they would look nice and 
			not have wrinkles in them. She wasn't always able to attend church but went as 
			often as she could, walking 8 blocks to get there. At the age of seventy, she 
			went to the temple and did 20 Baptisms, then went through a session for an 
			Endowment in one day and afterwards she walked up Canyon Road to her daughter 
			Carlyn's for the rest of the day to help her.</p>
		<p>There was only a couple of times they had a car that I can remember so they had 
			to go with a horse and wagon, or walk, or some one else take them. And 
			sometimes she and a neighbor walked to the West end of town to go visiting 
			teaching -- 10 blocks. She lived in the east end of town and was a visiting 
			teacher for several years. She sometimes went to Logan by the street car, 
			walking 8 blocks to catch it.</p>
		<p>Lizzie made many quilts in her life time for herself, children and grandchildren 
			as well as helping many other people quilt. She was a very beautiful quilter 
			and in later years was asked by other people to quilt for them, even by some 
			people from other states. She did much crocheting and embroidery work for her 
			children and grand children, also made afghans. She didn't do much traveling in 
			her life time as she didn't have much opportunity to do so. She went a few 
			places in Idaho.</p>
		<p>In the year of 1934 they bought a little house down in town and sold the farm. 
			They wanted to be closer to church and store and Lola couldn't farm anymore.</p>
		<p>They celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary after moving down town, with an 
			open house given by their children. Many people called to wish them well for 
			the occasion.</p>
		<p>She had some illness in her life and one time was in the hospital, which was on 
			Main Street between First and Second North, on the top story over there where 
			Palmer's Plumbing is now. She was there about 10 days. She had a mid-wife when 
			most of her children were born and the last few had a Doctor besides a 
			mid-wife. She got diabetes when middle-aged, and had it for the rest of her 
			life. She controlled it with a diet for some time and then took pills.</p>
		<p>When Carlyn lived with them, Lola killed a pig and Lizzie and Carlyn helped 
			scrape the hair off the pig. When Carlyn worked, Lizzie tended her two girls 
			until Carlyn married again, this time to Tom Rowley. One time Norma didn't get 
			to the field fast enough and the cows got bloated. Lizzie with the help of 
			Carlyn and John Kirby took care of them as Lola wasn't home at the time.</p>
		<p>When her Mother or Aunt passed away, she inherited a piece of ground with a home 
			on it and a piece of farm land and after a few years she sold it. Their son 
			Levi lived with them after he married in part of the house, until he moved to 
			Idaho.</p>
		<p>
			When Lola and Lizzie moved to town, they never had a telephone until later 
			years. They went to James I. Kirby one year to hear Conference on a radio that 
			used ear phones. They had what they call block parties and all the neighbors 
			would come. Lola and Lizzie had them at their home quite often. One time 
			Richard Nielsen Arnet, Annie's boy, drank their vanilla.</p>
		<p>In the year 1963, in February, her husband passed away at the Logan Hospital, 
			leaving her a widow. She lived for six years alone following his death. When 
			her grandson Blaine Wickham, went on his mission in 1967, she told him she 
			would not be there when he came back, and when sending a tape to him, she bore 
			a great testimony to him. She died just 8 months before he came home, on 1 
			January 1969 and he returned home in May 1969. She died in the Logan LDS 
			Hospital.</p>
		<p>She was loved and respected by her family and all who knew her. She lived 
			faithful to the end of her life. There were many relatives and friends who came 
			to pay their respects at her funeral, and she was buried in the Hyde Park 
			Cemetery by the side of her faithful and loving husband.</p>
		<p>Elizabeth's parents were both born in England where they joined the Church and 
			immigrated to the U. S. A. They both came to Hyde Park, Utah to live where they 
			met and married. Her Mother and Aunt were the only ones of her family to come 
			to the U.S.A., the rest stayed in England. The Waite family all come to this 
			country to live. Her Parents later moved to Dayton, Idaho where they both died 
			and were buried at Weston, Idaho Cemetery. Her father was a farmer.</p>
