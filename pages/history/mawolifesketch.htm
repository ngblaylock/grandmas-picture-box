		<p>The subject of this sketch was the first child and only daughter of John Waite 
			and Sarah Noble Waite. Born the 2nd of March 1843 at Gosberton, Clough, 
			Lincolnshire, England.
		</p>
		<p>The Waite family had lived in the Parish of Gosberton for two generations back. 
			The Noble family can be traced back to the town of Wyberton. About ten miles 
			distant. Both families were known to be honorable, industrious, and hard 
			working people, which made it possible for them, by their economy and frugality 
			to make a respectable living.
		</p>
		<p>Grandfather Waite, in religious matter, leaned toward the Methodist and was a 
			member of that Society up to his death, which occurred in his 88th year. 
			Grandmother Waite, whose maiden name was Anne Davis, died ten years previous at 
			the age of 85 years. Grandfather Noble was a Protestant and died at the age of 
			70 years and Grandmother died at the age of 37 years, left a family of six 
			young children, 3 boys and 3 girls. The oldest was only 12 years old, and the 
			youngest a baby.
		</p>
		<p>Father John Waite had five children, four boys and one girl. I am not sure of 
			the exact date when the Latter Day Saint Elders came down to Gosberton 
			Risegate. However, the parents of Sister Martha Ann were among the first in 
			that vicinity that accepted the Gospel as taught by the Mormon Elders. She 
			being a girl of about ten years accepted the Gospel with all her heart and 
			faithfully maintained and lived up to its precepts. Ever ready to bear her 
			testimony to its Divinity all the day long which brought down on her devoted 
			head the jeers and ridicule of her companions at school.
		</p>
		<p>Martha Ann was very studious and painstaking at school, worked hard and 
			faithfully at her lessons. Always prepared was her motto. And by her constant 
			application to her books, she became among the foremost in school. It became a 
			noted fact that she always stood at the head of her class, which fact caused 
			much jealousy and hatred from her classmates. This little black eyed Mormon 
			girl, with small classic features, whose black curly hair, out-rivaled the 
			sheen of the raven's wing, had much to contend with on that account. However, 
			when the time came for a spelling match at the week's end, they all forgot that 
			she was a poor little Mormon girl. They only remembered that she was a very 
			good speller and that the side that was fortunate to choose her was sure to win 
			while the opposite side would meet with defeat. I remember distinctly many 
			times while sitting and looking with intense interest while a very small boy, 
			watching the long line of boys and girls spelling or missing the word. But 
			there she stood! Calmly, anxiously, with determination flashing from her black 
			eyes waiting for another word, and as soon as the word was given it was spelt. 
			The murmur of satisfaction was whispered "Patty has won again."
		</p>
		<p>"But past is all her fame, the very spot where oft she triumphed is forgot."</p>
		<p>What was true about her spelling will hold good in arithmetic. Her classmates 
			knew where to go for assistance. The slates would be passed under the desk 
			while she worked any a hard long example for her school friends.
		</p>
		<p>She had one true and trusted friend, Mr. George Fox, the teacher, who always was 
			very proud to exhibit her work to visitors especially when the minister would 
			call, he would pat her on her head and say "Your work is excellent." Years 
			after that the writer of this sketch was compelled to use a copy book 
			unfinished, also a book that was used to copy all number work of hers. I 
			presented the same to Mr. Fox, the teacher, for examination to ascertain If 
			they were suitable for me to use. After Mr. Fox looked through carefully both 
			books, he asked me whose books are these? I answered, my Sister Martha's. "Yes, 
			yes," he said, I had forgotten her. Martha was indeed a very nice little 
			scholar. It is a pity she could not have remained in school longer. She would 
			have made her mark in the educational world." He turned to me, and said, "Jose, 
			you have a very fine example set you In those books by your Sister. I hope you 
			will keep them in the same condition as they are today, for there is not a blot 
			or stain nor mistake within the lids of either book."
		</p>
		<p>Some of us backward boys thought Mr. Fox was very unkind and harsh, but Martha 
			could not be made to believe anything of the sort. He was to her kindness 
			personified. Always approached her with a smile and a kind word. He was a man 
			that loved learning for 1earning sake. He would not, and did not tolerate a 
			shirker.
		</p>
		<p>"A man he was, severe and stern to view,</p>
		<p>I knew him veil, and every truant knew</p>
		<p>Well had the boding tremblers leaned to trace</p>
		<p>The day's disasters In his morning face.</p>
		<p>Full well they 1aughed with counterfeited glee</p>
		<p>At all his jokes, for many a joke had he;</p>
		<p>Full well the busy whisper, circling around</p>
		<p>Conveyed the dismal tidings when he frowned."</p>
		<p>
			After school days were ended, she remained at home and faithfully complied with 
			her church duties. She possessed a very good voice, and was rated as a nice 
			singer. Her voice would be heard every Sunday afternoon and night in the 
			meetings. The meetings were held in her Father's house for many years. She was 
			Branch clerk and treasurer, kept all the church books and funds, to the time 
			she emigrated to Zion. She would go out with the Elders when they held open-air 
			meetings to sing for them and distribute tracts and sell church works. She 
			deprived herself of the joys of the world for the Gospel sake. She seemed 
			indeed to have come out of the world In spirit and feeling long before she was 
			permitted to come In person. She seemed to be a1most the village scribe for 
			whoever and whenever they wanted a letter written or read, she was invariably 
			sent for and cheerfully responded. So by so doing she made many friends. Her 
			services were appreciated if her religion was not. She, like all other girls 
			had her love troubles. Her first love was a young man that was a member of the 
			Church. Very zealous and faithful withal. I believe they were promised to each 
			other. He, however, emigrated with the intention and promise to send for her in 
			the near future. However, men sometimes break their promises. This 
			young&nbsp;man was not an exception to that rule. After arriving in Utah, 
			letters came with regularities for some time. But for some reason afterwards 
			they came with less frequency. It was the old, old story. He loved another. But 
			he was magnanimous enough to still retain a corner in his heart for her. Would 
			she take second place? That question was answered in the negative. I do believe 
			it was the man she had lost faith in and not the principle. Subsequently, she 
			was apprenticed to a dressmaker named Mrs. Willows for one year. Martha became 
			a full-fledged dressmaker. That was before sewing machines were invented, and 
			all sewing was done by hand. So Martha became an accomplished needlewoman. She 
			worked around in the neighborhood for one shilling per day, she also received 
			three meals per day. She would work from eight o'clock in the morning to six at 
			night.
		</p>
		<p>In the year 1865, April 19th, Martha with the rest of the family sustained the 
			loss of a parent, viz, a kind and affectionate Father. She was much devoted to 
			him, and no father was more devoted to his daughter than her deceased father. 
			It seemed that her prospects of ever coming to Zion were father away than ever. 
			The fact of losing her father by death rested very heavily on her shoulders. 
			Her sorrow was intense for some time. The testimony of the gospel stood her 
			well in hand at that frying experience. She passed through and came out of the 
			ordeal with a sublimer love and a stronger faith than before in the great 
			tatter Thy Work. In fact, she seemed to have been transformed from a member of 
			the family to the head. She became more insistent in her church duties, more 
			exacting with herself, and ever trying to encourage the rest of the family to 
			do likewise.
		</p>
		<p>Mother followed nursing after father's death, which business took her away from 
			her home a great deal of the time. For that reason, Martha seemed at the head. 
			She made a model housekeeper, ever kind and obliging to her brothers, washed 
			and patched their clothes, and cooked their food. However, we always knew it 
			mattered little to her what might have happened to them adversely in this sense 
			of losing a job through dull times. We always received a kind and hearty 
			welcome home. There was a strong cord of friendship existing between her 
			brothers and herself.
		</p>
		<p>"Careless their merits or their faults to scan;</p>
		<p>Her pity gave ere charity began."</p>
		<p>In her life there is one important incident I have omitted I will refer to. This 
			happened in her school days which subsequently caused her much pain and 
			suffereing for many years. It happened this was a group of girls, more large 
			and others small, in a very boisterous fun making spirit, locked arms and tried 
			to throw each other down. In a game like that one can readily see that the 
			weakest must go to the wall. Martha being the smallest, fell to the ground and 
			all the other girls fell upon her; Her shoulder was twisted under her and 
			broken. Many, any nights no sleep came to her eyes for several years. However, 
			in time her arm became stronger and later on I doubt if she suffered very much 
			from it, unless she had to do very heavy work. I believe that is the chief 
			reason she resolved to become a dressmaker. For in the old world all must work 
			if they expect to eat; moreover, the lower class would not be thought 
			respectable if they did not qualify themselves to work for a living.
		</p>
		<p>As years rolled on, Martha became quite useful in the branch. Her merit was 
			recognized by the travelling Elders and none more so than by Elder L. W. 
			Shurtliff. They became very good friends, and talked, and sang
		</p>
		<p>"0 Zion, When I Think of Thee."
		</p>
		<p>"I long for pinions like a dove,
		</p>
		<p>And often sigh to think that I should be
		</p>
		<p>So distant from the land I love, etc."
		</p>
		<p>Subsequently, Elder Shurtliff, who has been President of the Weber Stake of Zion 
			for many years, was transferred from the Nottingham Conference to the London 
			Conference, and corresponded occasionally with the clerk of the Risegate 
			Branch. And those letters put new life and faith into the heart of my sister in 
			the question of "When Shall we go to Zion." And in the year 1869, month of 
			September, a letter came from London which bore the good news that Mother, 
			Martha and two brothers come quickly for the passage had been arranged for the 
			four to gather to Zion.
		</p>
		<p>
			No bride on the morning of her marriage looked more happy than did Martha. She 
			indeed was jubilant. The spirit of hope and faith burned with fervent love for 
			her deliverance from Babylon, as the old country was thought to be by the 
			faithful saint." Yes, my native land I leave thee, for in distant lands to 
			dwell," she murmured. My mother was at the time nursing a cousin who lived four 
			miles away. Martha after answering the letter received from Elder Shurtliff, 
			telling him we would all be there on the date appointed, the next thing to do 
			was to notify mother. So with hasty steps she brushed the dew away to meet and 
			tell the good news to her mother. Forty-five years afterwards, the writer 
			called at the same house to see the same people while on a mission to my native 
			land. Lizzie Noble (my cousin's wife) asked me in these words: "I have often 
			wondered if Martha ever realized one half of what she expected or anticipated 
			when she got to Utah. Why, if she had been sure that she would have married 
			into the Royal Family, she couldn't have been more happy." "Yes, I answered, 
			'She fully realized all she anticipated, for she married an honorable, upright 
			man who was true and faithful to her through life, and died in full faith of a 
			glorious Resurrection."
		</p>
		<p>We sailed from Liverpool in the steamship "Minnesota", Guron's line, on the 4th 
			of October, 1869. She was sick the entire trip across the ocean, twelve days. 
			Mother took care of her all the way. However, arrived at New York viz Castle 
			Gardens. She asked for bread and cheese which she seemed to relish very much. 
			In a few days she was well, took train for Utah, arrived at Ogden on the 28th 
			day of October 1869. There was a serious accident which occurred one hundred 
			miles east of Ogden. Three persons were killed and two others were badly 
			injured. Our train telescoped into the one ahead. We were delayed twelve hours, 
			after which we arrived at Ogden as described above.</p>
		<p>Our intention was to go South, via American Fork, to some friends whom we knew 
			in England. However, Bro. Brigham Dudley of Willard went down to Ogden to try 
			to secure a family to rent his farm the coming season. My brothers Levi and 
			myself were sturdy, healthful looking boys. Brother Dudley spoke to me, and 
			asked me if I wished a place to work. I answered him in the affirmative. Said 
			he, "I will furnish you all the land you can tend, and team, etc." "I live 
			fifteen miles north of here. The town is named Willard". I found Levi and 
			Mother and Martha. We soon agreed to go with him. We piled our trunk and 
			everything we had into his wagon and were soon on the way to our unknown homes 
			feeling grateful in our hearts for the good friend the Lord had sent us in the 
			person of Bro. Brigham Dudley. We arrived at the farm late, nearly midnight. 
			There was a bed in one corner which Martha and Mother slept in. The boys 
			occupied the floor. We had our own bedding. The last thing the English people 
			think of doing at night is to lock the door. Martha tried to shut the door, 
			However, it fell down. Oh, what a change in her countenance now. I really 
			believe she wished for the green lanes of Bonnie England. She couldn't sleep in 
			such a place as this, she said. That was the first time I ever heard her 
			murmur. Poor girl, she indeed was disappointed. However, we consoled her with 
			the statement of Mr. Dudley that if we didn't like the place he would take us 
			back to the train the next morning. She said she would surely go for she could 
			never live in a place like this. We piled all our trunks one on top of another 
			against the door in lieu of a lock, and retired to bed. Next morning, Mr. 
			Dudley took us up to the fort and gave us a square meal, after which we bid 
			them all adieu with the intention of going to American Fork. Bear in mind we 
			had all looked up to Martha for advice and counsel, for I am sure she had more 
			faith in Mormonism than both us boys at that time.
		</p>
		<p>On our way down to the Hot Springs Station my brother and I thought and talked 
			about the matter, with some misgivings. We felt somewhat like the dog in the 
			fable crossing the stream. That it would be unwise to give up the substance of 
			a job to chase a shadow way down to American Fork. We thought that probably the 
			prospects would not be any better for us, for we sensed the fact very keenly 
			that we were strangers in a strange land, and we would not afford to throw away 
			the offer of Mr. Dudley. Therefore, after a few minutes of conversation. Martha 
			yielded to our way of thinking, and said if we felt that way she would have no 
			more to say. So, Bro. Dudley turned the team around and came back to the farm. 
			Martha went to work for Sister Dudley for a season. We all fully agreed that 
			the Lord had a hand in keeping us at Willard. We found Bro. Robert Holmes and 
			Aunt Betsey, Bro. and Sister Taylor and considerate of us. In fact, I have a 
			warm place in my heart for all of the people, for we were hungry and they fed 
			us; we were strangers and they took us in.
		</p>
		<p>In the spring of 187l Martha Ann became the wife of Owen Owens of Willard, one 
			of the most honorable and upright man that I ever knew. Their married life was 
			one of perpetual joy. Many children blessed their home. Five grew up to man's 
			estate, four girls are now honored wives and mothers. Her only son, Jesse W. is 
			also married and has three children. He is highly respected in the circle in 
			which he lives. He filled an honorable mission in England a few years ago, to 
			the land of his parents. If those that pass to the Great Beyond have cognizance 
			of the acts of those that remain, poor Martha's spirit would indeed be proud of 
			her children, especially the one that was an ambassador of the Lord Jesus 
			Christ, for his Mother had the profoundest regard and esteem for the traveling 
			Elders. There were two or three that died in infancy. I will leave space for 
			another to fill.</p>
		<p>Martha became a Sunday School teacher, also assistant secretary in the Female 
			Relief Society, and an honored member in the same. However, her life was not 
			always strewn with flowers. Sickness and death came unbidden to her home 
			several times. The Government passed laws which made her husband a criminal and 
			liable to imprisonment on conviction and her dear self a _________, which 
			preyed very heavily on her mind, to see her husband hunted and driven from home 
			for carrying out the higher law, even the law which God had revealed anew in 
			this dispensation, which law she conscientiously accepted and believed in. But 
			to be branded as a wanton, was more than her sensitive nature could stand. Her 
			health was undermined, her spirit broken, and her poor heart stretched on the 
			keyboard of human suffering, shortening her days of life on earth materially. 
			In the spring of 1888, I think, she moved with her husband and family up to 
			Star Valley, Wyoming. There they built a home in a lovely vale of the 
			mountains. Here they looked forward in full faith to a happy consummation of a 
			realization to worship God according to their own conscience, where none may 
			come to hurt or make afraid. However, a wise Providence had ordered it 
			otherwise. The previous trials that she had undergone had sapped her vitality 
			beyond the healing point. The spring had passed, the surer was waning when 
			death claimed her as his own. She found life's burden too heavy, and being 
			tired and weary laid it down to rest. She died in full fellowship in the 
			church, a faithful Latter Day Saint. A kind sister, a lovely maiden, a pure 
			high-minded woman, a true and devoted wife and mother. Her deeds live in the 
			hearts of those who knew her best. I don't think she had an enemy or a foe. She 
			indeed was a peacemaker. "Blessed are the Peacemakers, for they shall be called 
			the Children of God."
		</p>
		<p>In conclusion, dear girls, I admonish you as one who knew her best. Follow her 
			example, cherish her memory, teach her virtues to your children while they are 
			still small and around your knees. She was and is a dear, loving sister to me 
			"And ever near us, though unseen, the dear immortal spirits tread, for all the 
			boundless universe if live-there are no dead."
		</p>
		<p>Dedicated to my sister's children 15 day of March, 1917, I remain your 
			affectionate uncle
