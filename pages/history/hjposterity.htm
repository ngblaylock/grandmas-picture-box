<p>We should be proud of their blood running through our veins,
For a stalwart heritage who made possible, us grasping life&#146;s
reins. Eight children blessed this couple with standards high, A
family that has helped bring happiness to many, we can&#146;t
deny. Names from the Bible were chosen to be one of the children&#146;s
crowns, And they proudly did their names justice, whether they
wore pants or gowns </p>

<p>Don&#146;t we feel proud of JACOB who proved to be a pioneer
in every way? And of his helpmate Melvina, ever by his side day
by day, Encouraging him and both being brave to help break
traditions that &quot;this isn&#146;t possible&quot;, you&#146;ll
lose your shirt Jake. For it took men and women like this to
prove &quot;it can be done&quot;, People who weren&#146;t afraid
of hard work, sweat and the feel of discouragement's gun. How the
posterity of these two Jorgensen&#146;s must fill with pride,
When they hear stories how Jake and Melvina took life in their
stride. </p>

<p>ISAAC, must have made his parents smile as his talent unfolded
to them, A worker in the rich soil that will ever produce a new
gem. One of God&#146;s faithful women was also a great gift to
this man, Together they worked and schemed to help develop God&#146;s
great plan. Their children were so welcome and truth prevailed at
every turn, They worked as a unit in those long ago days and did
yearn To give their posterity a candle to work by all, their
lives through, Whether they be doctors, lawyers, farmers or
whatever they chose to do. For they realized in life its worth,
and the everlasting beauty, And as Mom and Dad or Aunt Rebecca
and Uncle Isaac they did their duty. So we salute this family
head who stands in line for a vote of thanks, And who, wherever
they are in righteousness, hold high ranks. </p>

<p>ABRAHAM also did his name proud, although not in worldly fame,
But in worthwhile, useful achievement just the same. Aunt Minnie
thought him an awfully good person to know,</p>

<p>As their relationship grew into years you could feel this same
glow. A glow that their children, and children&#146;s children
will ever speak of with respect,</p>

<p>For they are so proud of their pioneer heritage who ever stood
erect, On every principle that helps to make family bonds tied
with a knot, Ties, that even with all the money and fame
possible, cannot be bought. How thankful they must feel to be
born of such goodly stock, To know their &quot;houses were not
built of sand but of solid rock.&quot; </p>

<p>JOSEPH came along and wasn&#146;t missing any of his brothers
traits, He also did his part in letting God guide him through
good gates. The Jorgensen&#146;s name carried down through Uncle
Joe and Aunt Janies family tree Can boast of farmers and business
men who the world could desire to I&#146;ll bet this posterity
have many wonderful tales to tell, Of a big yellow brick house
where children in fun did yell. Also, how they were trained to
appreciate mother nature&#146;s pleasures As they plowed,
harrowed, irrigated and hoed their parents treasures So the
memory of Joe and Jennie to this fine family is revered, They
must feel humble thanks today, and often, for how they were
reared. </p>

<p>MOSES was a name Hans and Dorthea also did choose, But who
would ever deny Uncle Moses not filling the shoes. He and Aunt
Rue had their heartaches and joys with the rest, But could
somehow interpret it as being for the best. Nanna knew a home
with them that must fill her with love, Recognizing they were
chosen spirits coming from a high above. Patient, kind and with a
sense of humor too. Couldn&#146;t we all gain from their lives an
important life's clue The feminine side of the family we will now
interview.</p>

<p>MARIA, a strong personality of which today there are few.
Never too tired or busy to be an angel of mercy to the sick,
There wasn&#146;t a problem or disaster that with her outlook on
life; couldn&#146;t lick She homesteaded for two husbands and
children she held dear, Teaching them if they lived righteously
they had nothing to fear. there was always roan at her house for
one more to come and abide, Many have profited by wise advice
given while working or visiting by her side. Her posterity take
their places proudly in the world today, Excelling in their
chosen fields, whether farmers, or if they have a new road to lay.
She knew the meaning of physical labor and even pain before she
passed away, But to a reward saved just for her; for
accomplishments in life lived day by day.</p>

<p>MARY. She chose a God-fearing man to walk by her side ever
steady, Anything put before then to work out together they were
always ready. Whether it was for their children, who came in an
even dozen, Or for the happiness of anyone or anything) be it an
animal or cousin. their doors always bad Welcome written across
the wood, People were meant to be happy here, at least they did
all they could. Family projects, family dinners and family jokes
were ever a circle round, In that Big Red house there was seldom
a quiet sound. Aunt Mary could cook food to bring out the flavor
divine, As well as cleverly teach truth and kindness to the
utmost sublime. To be able to call her that precious word
Grandma, friend, mother or aunt, to describe what that choice
spirit stands for to her posterity, I can&#146;t. How proud these
two Monks would be to view the abilities of posterity they love
so, Doctors, dairy men, business men, scholars, bishops, and so
many who their church love and know. Would bring tears of
thankfulness to their eyes as at each they would smile
Immediately planning a farni1y dinner; after all they should be
busy and doing something worthwhile.</p>

<p>REBECCA describes a very patient, kind and unselfish person
when brought to our family test, She so helped to influence the
privileged people who knew her the very best. Her talents were
not hidden but developed and grew no end, Especially when those
things she knew were right she stood to defend. She proved to be
such a wise choice for Uncle Pete Frost to desire, And was the
kind of mother and neighbor anyone would like to acquire. She
taught good things every day of her life through, To her own
flesh and blood, or peoples of every hue.</p>

<p>She had a desire to help her fellow man in any fix, Using her
many gifts and talents that some people called &quot;some tricks.&quot;
The Hans and Dorthea family wouldn&#146;t have been complete
without this accomplished lass, To her wonderful, devout family,
the name, Rebecca in this whole Jorgensen family heads the class.
</p>

<p>Oh! shouldn&#146;t we feel grateful for relatives so strong
and true, They hold a challenging example before me and you. God
Bless them for the indelible memories they&#146;ve left behind,
Where could we have chosen a better heritage of any kind? </p>
