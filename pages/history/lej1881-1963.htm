			Owen Waite now lives, Here their first child Venna was born, when she was three 
			months old Grandfather was called on a Mission to Denmark, where after about a 
			year he was released because of poor health. Two more children were born to 
			this couple while still living in the small house, they were Berdice and 
			Carlyn, chile Carlyn was still infint they moved in there home on the bill, 
			during a span of years the rest of their family was born the were Lyda, Arda, 
			Everett, Levi, Cleon, Norma and Orlin the baby who passed away. During this 
			time Lola was engaged in farming; he also was Sexton for the Hyde Park Cemetary 
			for 20 years. Amoung some of the things he did for a liveng were Blacksmithing, 
			Hauling Milk, Loging. While loging one winter up Logan Canyon his sled went 
			through some ice on the river, Grandfather unhitched the horses from the sled 
			and walked back to camp behind the horses, when he reached camp his clothing 
			was frozen to him and he had to stand by the fire and thaw out before he could 
			remove his clothing and change into dry cloths. He also worked on a threshing 
			machine, these are a few of the things he did to earn a living for his family.</p>
		<p>He loved his Church and worked in many of the Auxiliaries, He didn't believe in 
			working on Sunday. Scouting was the greatest joy to him he worked in Scouting 
			for about 35 years and always held a spot in his heart for it. He took many 
			trips into the canyon on horse back with the boys and would stay for a week at 
			a time. He also&nbsp;did Temple work and Genealogy. Many times he would walk to 
			Logan for an appointment and then walk back home. Grandfather and Grandmother 
			lived for a year with Mr. Hurren taking care of him and his hone.</p>
		<p>When Grandfather was ready to retire he bought the home where they have been 
			living, but he couldn't content himself to set back and relax; he always had to 
			be doing something as long as he was able to. So you would see him out in his 
			yard doing what had to be done if he possible could do it.</p>
