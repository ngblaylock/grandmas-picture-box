		<p>Immediately after our graduation I went to school in Pocatello for one year. The 
			things that highlighted that year were the rewarding opportunities which were 
			given me such as giving a facial to a lady who came in with a bad headache - 
			watching her relax and fall asleep and wake up with the headache gone. Then I 
			had a weekly schedule with three or four bald headed men who came (in despair) 
			for an ultra treatment to try and restore their charm. It was fun and funny but 
			nevertheless did some good.</p>
		<p>The following summer Everett and I dated and were married in November of that 
			fall (1940). We were married in the Logan Temple. The following spring we went 
			to Lost River to farm. We had lots of fun fishing, even on the Mackey Dam. We 
			lived there eleven years. We bought eighty acres of farm ground while there. 
			The winter of 1951 we had so much snow that we decided to find a warmer climate 
			- thank goodness.</p>
		<p>With the goodness of the Lord we managed to keep our farming and finances on the 
			up while we raised our seven children -- all of whom have had a temple 
			marriage. Everett, our three sons, and four sons-in-law have all served in 
			missionary work. All of the grandsons have served missions as they became of 
			age. Just this month I have seen our first two grandchildren married in the 
			Mesa and Boise Temples.</p>
		<p>One of the more fun type church activities that we accomplished was when we 
			taught and took a group of young people from Lost River Stake to participate in 
			the June Conference dance festival in Salt Lake City. One of the most hilarious 
			trips we went on was when Everett and I, our youngest daughter Gaynel, and son 
			Jesse, our youngest married daughter Jolene and her husband Kent, my sister and 
			her husband whom we hadn't ever met before all got in our new station wagon and 
			went to the world's fair in Spokane.</p>
		<p>At the present time we have thirty-six living grandchildren (lost one at birth). 
			We'll probably see many vocations in life within the confines of our family. 
			One is already on his way to being a doctor and has married into the family of 
			the Vice-President of the Aloe Vera Corporation. They're really great people.</p>
		<p>As a family we've had many cherishable memories right here on our own place - 
			both in work and play. For the past two years Everett managed his business from 
			his little corner in the dining room where he chose to go because of health 
			problems. From there he could see most of what was going on out doors. When we 
			reached our goal, we sold our cow herd. This was less than eight months ago.</p>
		<p>When Everett passed away in February 1988, he left me with an out-of-debt home, 
			and 120 acre farm. He was a hard-working husband. There aren't words to write 
			the tribute I would pay to him. It comes from the language of the heart. And in 
			conclusion I will say that in cherished thought and memory loved ones never 
			really part.</p>
