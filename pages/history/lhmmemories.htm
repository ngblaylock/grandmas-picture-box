<p><em>Aunt Lavina Jacobs and I, Linda Blaylock, have decided to
write a history of her mother and my grandmother. What prompted
this was our discussion on how our grandchildren will never know
life on the farm. We want to capture in this sketch, a feeling
for what life was like for my grandmother on the farm. Our
children and grandchildren live in a high tech age with
microwaves, digital cameras, DVDs, computers, refrigerators,
garage door openers and more things yet to come in the future
that we haven't even imagined. The explosion of knowledge in the
last century has been incomprehensible and this next 21</em><sup><em>st</em></sup><em>
century won't be any different. My grandchildren were born with
microwaves and computers in their homes. They have no idea what a
wood box is or what it's like to go down into the dirt cellar to
get the milk, instead of going to a refrigerator (or even to have
to milk a cow every night and morning). They don't understand the
significance of a successful vegetable garden. They know that
groceries come from a store. A great appreciation of the soil
comes from a great dependence on the soil for survival. In
grandma's day, they ate what they grew and grew what they ate. </em></p>

<p><u>Grandma</u></p>

<p>Grandma was medium framed with brown hair and brown eyes. She
had high cheek bones and an oval face. She wore gold rim glasses
and a kindly smile. She wore her hair long. She combed it up and
made a bob on top. When she wanted more fullness or a change, she
wore what was called a &quot;switch,&quot; which is a human hair
piece that was put in with her own hair, with hair pins. To make
waves in her hair, she used a &quot;waving lotion,&quot; which is
similar to our liquid gel, and long metal clamps that would clamp
the hair and cause it to wave. She always wore a cotton house
dress of moderate colors or prints, and an apron. Her shoes were
an oxford type which had laces and she wore long cotton hose
which came up over the knee and fastened with a garter. </p>

<p>Mary: &quot;In the early years we wore a panty waist. This was
similar to a tank top made of plain white cotton material. It
came to the waist and had four buttons , two in the front and two
in the back, that buttoned to the panties. The garters pinned
onto the panty waist. Elastic had not been invented at that time.&quot;</p>

<p>Linda: &quot;Did she ever wear ankle sox?&quot;.</p>

<p>Aunt Lavina: &quot;My word, it was a disgrace to wear anything
that didn't cover your legs. You would have been &quot;hooted&quot;
out of town.&quot; </p>

<p>On Sundays grandma wore a corset that had metal stays. It
cinched around her waist to give her a smaller waistline and make
her dresses fit nice. Her shoes were nicer but she never wore
high heels. Her clothes were always fashionable and she liked to
look nice. </p>

<p><u>Grandma as a young girl</u></p>

<p>Its hard to know what a person is like as a child unless you
have been around them. One thing we do know is the kind of people
grandma came from. On her father's side, the Harpers were Quakers
from Pennsylvania, for generations. Quakers were kind gentle
people who were very religious and who would do no harm to anyone.
On her mother's side, are also religious people, the Boyes and
the Taylors, who had come from England. Through this line she is
related to the Prophet, John Taylor.</p>

<p>With this information, and with knowing her children, it would
be a natural assumption that she was a very religious minded
person, even in her youth.</p>

<p>Charles: Mother was very religious. She told me when she lived
in Holiday, she and her sister May were in their teens they used
to go into Salt Lake to the Salt Lake temple to do endowment work.
They would take the wagon and buggy.</p>

<p>Linda: What did they do with the horses while they were doing
endowments?</p>

<p>Charles: They left the horses hitched to a hitching post.</p>

<p>Roma: In the cold weather, they would take the quilts they
used to wrap themselves in and throw them over the horses to keep
them from shivering.</p>

<p>(The information for this part is taken from her obituary)
&quot;Lavina Harper was born March 3, 1897, to Charles Alfred
Harper and Mary Boyes, at Big Cottonwood, (what is now known as
Holliday, Utah) This was also the birthplace of her husband,
Jesse T. Moses, and thus they were closely associated since early
childhood. </p>

<p>She received her early education in Holliday where she was a
good student and was admired and loved by her class mates for her
cheerful personality.</p>

<p>As a young girl, she showed talent in art and drama. She
belonged to a dramatic club in Holiday and took part in many of
its outstanding performances. She enjoyed this work very much and
was often called on to give readings at various entertainments.
Influenced by a near relative who was an artist, she painted
several beautiful pictures. Among one she finished was a picture
of Grandfather Woodruff's home in Vermont. Some of these
paintings still hang in her home to be cherished by her children
as a beautiful memory of their mother's gentle touch.&quot;</p>

<p><u>Grandma's sewing</u></p>

<p>She made her own clothes on a Singer treadle sewing machine.
She sewed work shirts for grandpa. She sewed shirts for the boys
and dresses for the girls in the family. She made their
underclothing also. She also made their nightgowns and pajamas.
She made all the pillowcases and sheets out of unbleached muslin.
After it was washed a few times it would be white. She made all
her quilts. She didn't waste anything. She took older clothing
and cut it into strips and when she had enough she took it to a
lady and had her weave it into a rug. Then she put straw under
the rug for padding. She embroidered designs on pillowcases and
crochet edges on pillowcases. She made tablecloths and
embroidered designs on them. </p>

<p>She saved feathers from chickens for pillows. When they lived
in Pingry, they had a pond that attracted lots of ducks. Harper
would go out and shoot five or six at a time for dinner. Grandma
would roast the ducks and Lavina and Arabell saved the feathers
and they each made themselves a down pillow.</p>

<p>Lavina: Leone was the 1st in the family to wear ankle sox. We
really had to coax mother to let her wear them. In those days the
elbow and knees had to be covered. The only time we wore pants
was a pair of coveralls when we helped out in the field.&quot;</p>

<p>Charles: During the depression years money was really lean.
Young boys wore knickers or short pants until they were around 12
years of age. Long pants were very expensive at that time. When I
was of the age where boys wear long pants, mother found a real
good buy on a pair of knickers with a suit and vest. The knickers
came down to my mid calves, so mother took the cuff off the
knickers and used the fabric from the vest and added onto the
knickers. She made me my first pair of long pants. She did a good
job and I was proud to have a pair of long pants.</p>

<p><u>Grandmas Garden</u></p>

<p>Linda: &quot;Whenever I ask anyone about Grandma Moses, the
first comment is the lovely garden she grew.&quot;</p>

<p>One of grandma's great talents was the ability to grow a great
garden and lovely flowers. She planted a row of Zinnias up the
middle of the garden. She saved seeds from the zinnias and
planted them the next year. They were big flowers with a variety
of color. She planted plenty of string beans and let them ripen
in the fall. We shelled them out and ate the dried beans through
the winter. She saved seeds and planted them again in the spring.
She taught her children to hoe and pull weeds and help her in the
garden. </p>

<p>She also canned lots of fruits and vegetables from her own
industrial labors. She didn't grow her own fruit though. The
climate wasn't favorable for growing peaches or pears. She bought
it from peddlers that brought it in town. Some of the things she
grew were strawberries, green beans, tomatoes, corn, peas, and
potatoes. </p>

<p>Linda: Did grandma do the gardening or did grandpa help?</p>

<p>After grandpa prepared the ground, she took care of the garden.
</p>

<p>Lavina: &quot;She just had a knack for growing things&quot;</p>

<p>Mary: &quot;She always planted a couple of rows of peas and a
row special for the kids to eat so they didn't eat from the
regular garden&quot;</p>

<p><u>Grandma's kitchen</u></p>

<p>As a grandma, we know that's where the grandchildren go first--straight
to the cookie jar. Grandma was a very good cook. We had very good
rice puddings, and good pies. Grandpa was a good biscuit maker.
Grandma had a black wood burning cook stove. It had a warming
oven on the top and a reservoir on the side for hot water.
Grandpa built a fire in the mornings and it was kept going all
day in the winter. In the summer it was used just to cook the
meals. When the black cook stove wore out, She and grandpa bought
a green enamel wood cook stove. It had a black top like the other
stove. They bought their first electric range in Riverside, when
they built the upstairs on their house. </p>

<p>Grandma was a good cook. She cooked plenty of vegetables and
cookies and she made her own bread. In the early years when they
didn't have a refrigerator, grandpa dug a dirt &quot;root cellar.&quot;
It was close to the house so it would be handy. They had steps
going down into it. They had shelves to put fruit and vegetables
on and a separate room in it for the milk. To get down into it,
you had to open a door from the top.</p>

<p>To preserve the meat, grandpa would butcher a beef in the
winter when it was cold and hang it outside. They kept it covered
so it wouldn't dry out. Grandpa also butchered pigs. He smoked
the hams and cured the bacon. Grandma would make up sausage in
round patties and put it in a crock. Then she rendered out the
lard and poured over the sausage to preserve it. Also for meat,
Harper would hunt for ducks and pheasants. They also had plenty
of chickens. </p>

<p>Lavina: &quot;We had to use up our food. If there was
leftovers we had them for the next meal.&quot;</p>

<p>Sunday dinner was mostly fried chicken or roasted with
dressing. That was always our holiday dinner because we didn't
raise turkeys or have access to them. We didn't buy the chicken
at the store. We always raised chickens. On Saturday grandpa
would kill a couple of chickens. He would chop the head off, then
the chicken would jump around for a few minutes all over the
ground with it's head off, which is where the saying comes from,
&quot;running around like a chicken with its head cut off.&quot; </p>

<p>He would then put them in a bucket of scalding hot water,
which loosened the feathers. Then he plucked the feathers off and
drew out the entrails. He saved the heart, liver and gizzard to
cook. He washed the chicken and took a match and burned the hair
off the outside. Then he turned it over to grandma, who fried it
or roasted it.</p>

<p><u>Grandma's routine</u></p>

<p>Grandma was a progenitor of the Puritans who believed in a
weekly schedule starting with Monday as wash day. </p>

<p>Our washing machine was a wooded tub with an agitator in the
middle and a wheel on the side. It was filled with hot water from
an oval shaped boiler that was put on her wood stove to boil. We
poured the hot water into the wash tub, then we took turns
turning the wheel on the side which in turn made the agitator go
around, which washed the clothes. There was a wringer on the
washer which had a handle you turned by hand to wring the clothes
and then we put it in a rinse. Sometimes we used the wooden wash
board. To dry the clothes we hung them on a clothes line outside.
Even in the cold and freezing weather they would partially dry.
How happy the family was when they got an electric Maytag washer,
which , by guessing was in the late 30's. During the Depression
you could not buy appliances. </p>

<p>She was a very neat house keeper. On Saturday everyone took a
room to clean. Mother was very particular and made sure the work
was done well. She believed it was just as easy to put things
back were it belonged as to leave it sitting around. She always
kept things in their place. On Saturday evening after our work,
when we moved to Blackfoot, we always went to town and bought
groceries. </p>

<p><u>Grandma's town trips</u></p>

<p>Getting out of the house and going into town was a big event
for those who lived in Americas rural areas. To better explain
the town trips I have to explain what they did on a daily routine
that lead them to a weekly town trip.</p>

<p>Grandpa milked cows and we separated the milk. We had a milk
separator .It had a large bowl that we poured the milk in. There
were disks that separated the milk from the cream. There was a
handle on the side we turned. It had two spouts. One for the milk
and one for the cream. We took the cream and made butter with a
butter churn. It was a long narrow container with a dasher in the
middle that helped to separate the butter from the buttermilk. We
took turns churning the butter. Grandma took the butter and put
it in 1lb wooden molds. Then she wrapped them in a heavy wax
paper. It was then ready to store for our trip to the store.</p>

<p>She also raised chickens and she would take the butter and
eggs to town to trade for groceries.</p>

<p>Anyone in the family who was available would gather the eggs. </p>

<p>Leone: When I was a little girl my mother would give me an egg
and let me take it to the store in Riverside and trade it for
candy. Mother was very kind and unselfish. She never asked for
any for herself. She let me enjoy it all by myself because she
knew I liked candy.</p>

<p>In Lost River, Idaho, grandma had a favorite horse and buggy
she would use to go to town to trade her eggs and milk for
groceries at the store. She liked the single seat that would hold
only three people, so the children had to take turns going to the
store with her. </p>

<p>Lavina: &quot;We had two horse drawn buggies. One had two
seats and one had only one long bench. Mother liked the one with
one seat because she only had to have one horse. It was handier.
We took turns going into town with her because only three people
could ride at a time. It was about an all day trip. We would go
to the bakery and buy things for lunch. We went about every week.
We would talk Mother into going into Moore because the store
clerk would throw in a bag of candy with the trade.&quot;</p>

<p>Charles: In Pingry Mother fell out of the buggy. (Pingry is in
the Riverside, Blackfoot area.) We were all going to town as a
family. We were in the horse and buggy. In the fall when there
was snow we put the car away and took the buggy because of too
much snow.. We didn't have snow plows to keep the roads plowed so
the horse and buggy was the only way to get anywhere. We went
over a snow drift and the wheels cut down into the snow on one
side and Mother fell off the seat of the buggy into the snow
drift. We stopped right quick and got her into the buggy.</p>

<p>In the spring, the county would hire people with teams to hook
up a road grader and grade the roads so the cars could drive on
them again. They made good money doing it. They made $4.00 per
day.</p>

<p><u>Grandma the nurse</u></p>

<p>During world war I there was a Flu epidemic that went all over
the United States. Arabell was the first in our family to come
down with the flu. It was during the winter on a Thursday night
sometime after Christmas. Lavina went to school the next day and
on Saturday morning Lavina got sick. Mother came down with it on
Sunday. Then, whole family was down with the flu at the same time.
Uncle William had a farm next to our family. He would come to our
home and do the chores and stick his head in the door and ask if
there was something he could get us. One day he went to town and
brought us back some oranges. They tasted so good. After about
five days the family recovered all but Lavina and Arabell. It
took them about three weeks to recover. In the process of being
sick, Arabell's hair fell out. </p>

<p>Another incident of sickness was small pox. Charles picked
them up from school. Mother got it from Charles. As soon as the
rest of the family found out what it was they had, they went in
and got vaccinated and they didn't get them. </p>

<p>Lavina: Dad had been burning some sage brush in Lost River the
day before. Mother and Dad had gone to town. The sagebrush was
really thick there. Harper was walking along the fence and
stepped in some ashes and burned his foot. It was hurting so bad
that we went back to the house and Harper had me get him a basin
of cold water to put his feet in. I kept putting cold water in it
because Harper said it felt good. When Mother got home she
scolded us for putting his feet in cold water. As we find out
now, that was the best remedy for a burn. In those days they
treated a burn with salve and a bandage.</p>

<p>Roma: Some people were superstitious. They thought you drew
the heat out of a burn by putting heat on a burn.</p>

<p>Leone: When I was about 12, I got a very bad stomach ache in
my right side. The next day, it was still there so my parents
took me to the doctor. The doctor examined me and said I needed
surgery because of a bad appendix. My father gave me a blessing.
When the doctor did the surgery, he found the appendix had
ruptured but the poison had gathered at the place of rupture and
did not spread through my body.</p>

<p><u>Grandma's religion</u></p>

<p>Grandma was very spiritual minded. From the obituary; She kept
a record of the important events in her life which tell us of the
following:</p>

<p>On June 15, 1892, she was sustained as assistant secretary in
the Big Cottonwood Primary and in May 1894 she was appointed
Secretary.</p>

<p>January 28, 1897 she was sustained as assistant secretary and
treasurer of the YLMIA association and as assistant Secretary of
the Big Cottonwood Sunday School August 22, 1897.</p>

<p>From 1897 to 1902 she held positions as teacher in both the
Primary and Sunday School organizations and was later sustained
head teacher...(she had) good leadership and...Her chief
objective was to make truth live in the mind and soul.</p>

<p>Sister Moses was set apart as second counselor in the Primary
organization at Big Cottonwood April 25, 1901, and until November
1902 she was also a teacher in the Second Intermediate Department
in the Sunday School of the Holliday Ward.</p>

<p>Religion was a way of life for grandma. She went to church
every Sunday. They had Sunday School at 10:00 in the morning,
then Sacrament meeting in the early evening. She went to Relief
Society at 2:00 on Tuesday afternoon, then there was Primary on
Wednesday after school. They always had family prayer and she
taught her children when they were little kids to say their
prayers at night before they went to bed.</p>

<p>Lavina: &quot;When Mother was a child she used to tell us they
had fast meeting on Thursday, which was their testimony meeting.&quot;</p>

<p>On Sunday evening, grandpa used to read the scriptures to his
family. </p>

<p>Lavina: &quot;In the winter evenings after the chores were
done, we would play games and eat popcorn and apples and Dad
would read to us out of the scriptures.&quot; Every evening was a
home evening.</p>

<p><u>Grandma's children and school days</u></p>

<p>All grandma's children were born at home. Either a midwife or
a doctor would come to the home to delivery the baby. Grandma had
nine children. Mary was the oldest and Leone the youngest. Erma
was born in Nevada and died three weeks later from Pneumonia.
This was very difficult for grandma to loose her baby. She took
it pretty hard. Grandma had seven girls and two boys. Their names
were Mary, Harper, Arabell, Lavina, Vilate, Charles, Erma, Fern
and Leone.</p>

<p>Most of the school days were in Nevada, Lost River, or
Riverside. Getting to school was a challenge in the rural areas.
There were no snowploughs like we have now. They went in the fall
on what they called a bus, which was drawn by a team of horses.
When the snow got too deep, they used a bus sled, which was
pulled by the team of horses. </p>

<p>Mary: I didn't like Nevada. It was so lonely. For miles around
there was nothing but sagebrush. I shed many tears when we moved
there. Dad didn't like me crying about it, so I cried when he
wasn't around. To make it worse, the first year there, we had a
very mean teacher at school. If you didn't say the lessons in the
way that pleased her, she would thump your knuckles with a ruler.
You could only use the bathroom at recess or noon. A year later
we moved to a different farm that Dad rented with a nicer house
than the two room log cabin and the school was better.</p>

<p>Another thing we didn't like about Nevada was the jack rabbits.
Mother planted a large garden and the potatoes were up and green
and looking so great. We woke up one morning and looked at the
garden. It looked like it had been plowed up. All the green
shoots were gone and it looked like a new plow job. The rabbits
demolished the garden. Nothing anyone tried could get rid of the
rabbits. Some farmers dug under the ground and buried a fence
around their farm and the rabbits still got in to the crops.</p>

<p>Lavina: In Nevada, for one winter we had a one room school,
then again in Lost River we had a one room school for a winter,
then they built a new school which had two rooms with four grades
in each room.</p>

<p>Getting a high school education was a challenge but was
important to grandpa and grandma that their children have
education. There was no high school in Lost River. Mary went to
Smithfield and stayed with her grandma so she could get her high
school diploma. They didn't have the money to have the children
boarded in Arco, which was the custom for people when they lived
too far from a school, so Dad and mother moved to Blackfoot, so
the children would be able to have a high school education.
Harper stayed out of school for a year, then he and Arabell
started high school at the same time in Blackfoot. All the
children graduated from high school.</p>

<p>Harper had some college classes in business.</p>

<p>Arabell went to the LDS business college in Salt Lake and
graduated as a secretary. She worked in several secretary jobs
and also worked at the Logan temple.</p>

<p>When Leone was girl she used to spend hours fixing the hair on
a doll that belonged to her sister Mary. The doll had real hair
and Leone would wave it, then curl it, etc. She kept fussing with
it and combing it. As she got older, she fixed the hair of her
sisters and her Mother. She had a natural talent for fixing hair.
Leone went on beauty school when she finished high school and got
her license in cosmetology.</p>

<p><u>Closing tributes</u></p>

<p>The following is a tribute taken from a letter written by
Elder Charles Moses on 10 January 1942 while he was still on his
mission.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm looking forward to seeing you with a great deal of
pleasure. To know that I have good parents to go home to gives me
a great deal of joy and satisfaction. The fact that you taught me
the Gospel in my youth, both by precept and example, is the very
thing that causes me to hold a tender spot in my heart for you
now, with more love toward you than I could possibly have had,
had you showered me with the material things that millions could
buy and left untouched the Gospel Plan.&quot;</p>

<p>In talking to others about my grandmother there are two major
conclusions I have come to. The first is that to grandma, her
family is very important and second, she was serious in her
religious beliefs and kept her covenants with God. So, in closing
this history, I would like to pay a tribute to my grandmother
through Proverbs Chapter 31:10-31:</p>

<p>&quot;Who can find a virtuous woman? For her price is far
above rubies. The heart of her husband doth safely trust is her
so he shall have no need of spoil. She will do him good and not
evil all the days of her life. She riseth while it is yet night
and giveth meat to her household...She layeth her hand to the
spindle...She stretcheth her hands to the poor; yea, she reacheth
forth her hands to the needy...She looketh well to the ways of
her household, and eateth not the bread of idleness...Her
children arise up and call her blessed; her husband also, and he
praiseth her...Favour is deceitful, and beauty is vain; but a
woman that feareth the Lord, she shall be praised.&quot;</p>
