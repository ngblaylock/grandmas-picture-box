<p>During his long life, President Wilford Woodruff faced
accident and death so many times it took a record keeper of his
considerable talent to keep track. Among his misfortunes, he
suffered several broken bones, split his foot with an ax, was
bitten by a rabid dog, was battered by falling trees, came near
to being crushed by a water wheel, and on two occasions narrowly
missed being killed by gunfire. He came away unscathed from a
train wreck; was nearly drowned, frozen, and scalded to death;
and survived several life-threatening illnesses.</p>

<p>In 1856, as he faced a particularly harrowing ordeal from
blood poisoning, he wrote: &#147;I have been a marked victim as
an attack for the power of the destroyer from my infancy up to
the present day. I have faced accident, misfortune, and
apparently death so many times and in so many shapes and forms
from my childhood through life thus far that it has become a
proverb with me to say that there has seemed to be two powers
constantly watching me and at work with me, one to kill and the
other to save me.&#148;</p>

<p>After pondering the meaning of it all, he came to the
conclusion that &#147;the devil knew if I got into the Church of
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints I would write the history of
the Church and leave on record the doings, works, and teachings
of the prophets and Apostles, elders and Saints in the latter
days and that I would attend to the ordinances of the House of
God for my father&#146;s household and friends, both for the
living and the dead.&#148;</p>

<p>Although a man of the land, without formal education, Wilford
Woodruff nevertheless became one of the premier record keepers of
the nineteenth century. The same Spirit that convinced him of the
truths Mormon missionaries brought to him also motivated his
tireless writing. Besides, the Prophet Joseph Smith, upon
organizing the Quorum of the Twelve, had commanded the Apostles
&#147;to write and keep a journal or history of their lives.&#148;</p>

<p>Wilford Woodruff joined the Latter-day Saints at a time when
record keeping in the Church was in its beginning stages&#151;a
time when valuable records were lost due to unsettled conditions,
when caretakers of the Church history apostatized and took
records with them, and when faithful participants in the
unfolding drama of the kingdom often kept no record at all. All
of this contributed to Wilford Woodruff&#146;s great anxiety to
keep a careful record of his own. For him, record keeping was
more than a casual activity; it was a religious service. He not
only kept a diary and collected family records but also carried
on an extensive correspondence.</p>

<p>Something of President Woodruff&#146;s tenacity is seen in an
incident that occurred in 1879 while he was living in a remote
area of Arizona, 165 miles from a post office. After a few days&#146;
absence from home, he returned to find forty-one letters.
Persuading the mail carrier to wait for him to answer his
correspondence, he embarked on a writing marathon during which he
produced thirty-six letters in three days and nights of almost
uninterrupted writing. He said that he wrote &#147;until my hand
and arm became numb and brain ceased to act,&#148; and he was
forced to stay in bed in great pain for four days with what he
called &#147;bilious cramps.&#148;</p>

<p>At the heart of the Woodruff literary legacy is his daily
journal. Beginning shortly after his conversion and continuing to
his death in 1898, Wilford Woodruff&#146;s day books and
journals, comprising thirty-one handwritten volumes, cover almost
the entire span of the Church&#146;s nineteenth-century history.
For Elder Woodruff, the writing of a diary was inherent in
ordination to the priesthood. As an avid student of the past, he
recognized that the story of God&#146;s dealings with mankind
could not be written without the records of eyewitnesses. And the
records of the commoner are as important as those of the king.
&#147;You may say that historians have handed [the history of
nations, kingdoms, and countries] down unto us. But how have
historians obtained materials from which to compile their
history? I answer from the scribes, reporters, and journalists
who wrote day-by-day events as they passed before their eyes. And
this class of men forms the foundation of all history, and from
their material, historians who live hundreds of years after
events transpire will compile history.&#148;</p>

<p>Addressing a congregation of Saints in 1862, Elder Woodruff
regretted that so few contemporary records had been kept of the
events of Church history, and then rehearsed his own efforts:
&#147;I seldom ever heard the Prophet Joseph, or Brigham Young,
or the Apostles teach, preach, or prophesy or perform any
official act but what I have recorded it in my journals unless
some other persons were recording the same, and I could not feel
easy until I had accomplished it.&#148; He continued, &#147;I
have written more sacred history of the teaching of the prophets
and Apostles and official acts of the Latter-day Saints than
would make several testaments as large as the one handed down to
us by the ancient Apostles. I have kept a journal of almost every
day of my life since I have been a member of this Church.&#148; A
few years earlier he had observed that &#147;a great portion of
the Church history has been compiled from my journals, and some
of the most glorious gospel sermons, truths, and revelations that
were given from God to this people &#133; could not be found upon
the earth on record only in my journals.&#148; For example, of
sixteen discourses of Joseph Smith recorded by Wilford Woodruff
in his diary, nine are exclusive reports preserved by no one else.</p>

<p>In addition to his personal record keeping, Elder Woodruff
served history in other ways. In 1852 he was appointed clerk and
historian of the Quorum of the Twelve. Four years later he began
thirty-four years of service as a historian in the Church
Historian&#146;s Office. As he began his new assignment, it
became his responsibility to write the history of the Church
during the last days of Joseph Smith&#146;s life. This was a
challenging task due to the lack of firsthand information, but by
soliciting accounts from widely scattered eyewitnesses and
carefully analyzing their contradictory reminiscences, Elder
Woodruff was finally able to complete the history through the end
of the Prophet&#146;s lifetime. He then continued the narrative
into the presidency of Brigham Young. He also produced a history
of eight of the first members of the Quorum of the Twelve. In
recognizing Elder Woodruff&#146;s efforts, George A. Smith
observed in 1860 that he &#147;had done more to preserve the
history of this Church than any man on the earth.&#148;</p>

<p>In his capacity as a Church historian, Elder Woodruff lost no
opportunity to encourage the Saints to keep personal records. In
1853 he exhorted brethren of the priesthood to keep a journal and
history of their lives, &#147;for the record and history of this
church and kingdom will be wanted in a future day. There has been
no dispensation on earth the proceedings of which will be more
interesting than the one in which we live.&#148;</p>

<p>At a quarterly conference in Bountiful, Utah, Elder Woodruff
asked the assembled Saints, many of whom had traveled throughout
the earth and witnessed marvelous things, if they could &#147;not
count them worth recording&#151;not even make the mark of a pen
to leave the account on record for their children and future
generations to read? I say they should. I think the Lord requires
this at our hands, and it is a rich and holy legacy which is
justly due our posterity.&#148;</p>

<p>Elder Woodruff reminded a company of missionaries in 1856,
&#147;We are living in one of the most important generations that
man ever lived on earth, and we should write an account of those
important transactions which are taking place before our eyes in
fulfillment of the prophecies and the revelation of God. There is
a great flood of revelations fulfilling in our day, and as they
are transpiring before our eyes we want a record made of them.
&#133; If there was no other motive in view only to have the
privilege of reading over our journals and for our children to
read, it would pay for the time spent in writing it.&#148;</p>

<p>The other part of the answer Elder Woodruff had obtained to
his query as to why, throughout his life, he seemed to have been
marked for destruction by some evil force was that Satan knew
Wilford would bring salvation to his family, both living and dead.
Indeed, a substantial amount of President Woodruff&#146;s
writings reflect this concern for his family. When the light of
the gospel burst upon him, he frequently shared its hope with his
loved ones. In 1838, for example, with a &#147;deeper interest
than ever in the salvation of the soul of my father,&#148; he
stopped at the place of his birth in Connecticut, where he was
able to baptize not only his father but his stepmother, his only
sister, an aunt, and a cousin.</p>

<p>As the knowledge of salvation for those who had died without
hearing the gospel became known, Elder Woodruff&#146;s writings
reveal his efforts to provide saving ordinances for departed
family members. Feeling that he &#147;held the keys of the dead
of my father&#146;s house,&#148; he spent countless hours copying
their records and writing the genealogy of his family. In 1874 he
obtained access to a history of his hometown, Farmington,
Connecticut, and was elated to find references to ancestors of
both his mother&#146;s and father&#146;s lines. Although
suffering from a severe cold, he spent the better part of a week
writing the genealogy of his Connecticut family.</p>

<p>In 1876 he bought a history in which he found all the
descendants of ancestor Stephen Hart, born in Braintree, England,
in 1605. In the following weeks he spent many days &#147;getting
out the names of the Hart family for baptism.&#148; On June 20 he
recorded the fulfillment of his labors: &#147;Glory Hallelujah
for this day, for in spite of the Devil through the blessing of
God I have had the privilege &#133; of going into the Endowment
House and with my family have been baptized for 949 &#133; of my
dead relatives and friends.&#148; Two days later he repeated the
process for 924 others. Later in the year, he spent most of a
week in St. George &#147;preparing the names&#148; of Hart and
Woodruff ancestors for sealing in the newly constructed temple.
By 1885 his records had produced vicarious baptisms for 3,188 of
his family and friends, and endowments for 2,518 of them. To the
end of his life, President Woodruff actively corresponded with
relatives and others, including the New England Historical and
Genealogical Society, for family information.</p>

<p>Besides his desire to fulfill the purposes for which he
believed he had been repeatedly spared from death during his
lifetime, Wilford Woodruff, in the opening lines of his diary,
articulated another reason for his record keeping. He felt it was
his duty &#147;to keep a journal of my travels that when required
I may give an account of my stewardship.&#148; He therefore
carefully charted his own labors. &#147;Should we not have
respect enough to God to make a record of those blessings which
he pours out upon us and our official acts which we do in his
name upon the face of the earth?&#148; he once asked. So precise
was President Woodruff&#146;s &#147;journalizing&#148; that at
the beginning of each year he was able to quantify his official
acts during the previous year. And in 1885 he compiled a fifty-year
summary, observing that he had traveled 143,369 miles, held 4,191
meetings, and preached 3,250 discourses. Through his eight-month
ministry in England, 1,800 people were added to the Church, of
whom he personally baptized 1,043. He had organized 51 branches
of the Church, confirmed 3,343 individuals, ordained 23
patriarchs, 93 high priests, 59 seventies, 23 bishops, and 667
elders, and assisted in ordaining 4,347 others. He had also
ordained 446 priests, 66 teachers, and 15 deacons. He set apart
and blessed 1,034 missionaries and assisted with 4,512 others,
blessed 283 children, administered to 922 sick persons, worked in
the Salt Lake Endowment House 603 days, spent 111 days
supervising the digging of the Salt Lake Temple foundation, and
collected $1,674 for the Nauvoo Temple.</p>

<p>It was Will Durant who wrote that &#147;civilization is not
inherited; it has to be learned and earned by each generation
anew. &#133; The heritage that we can now more fully transmit is
richer than ever before. &#133; History is, above all else, the
creation and recording of that heritage. &#133; If a man is
fortunate he will, before he dies, gather up as much as he can of
his civilized heritage and transmit it to his children. And to
his final breath he will be grateful for this inexhaustible
legacy, knowing that it is our nourishing mother and our lasting
life.&#148;</p>

<p>If the reason for the inordinate number of accidents and
sufferings Wilford Woodruff experienced in his lifetime was, as
he believed, because Satan &#147;knew he would write,&#148; it
was also because few individuals would enlarge the memory of
mankind as effectively as he did.</p>
