<p class="TxBrp0" style="line-height:normal;tab-stops:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
It is a matter of actual record that as far back as 1647 there were three New
England colonists bearing the name of John Moses. Of these, the earliest mention
is of John Moses of Plymouth.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">There
is nothing to indicate relationship between him and John Moses of Portsmouth;
but family traditions and statements, as well as strong circumstantial evidence
and the inherent probabili­ties of the case, seem to determine beyond
reasonable doubt that he was the father of John Moses of Windsor. Several
accounts in the possession of the older branches of the descendants of John
Moses of Windsor state positively that he was the son of a John Moses of
Plymouth.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">From
these accounts one is selected that has several times been in print. In a
personal sketch of the late Schuyler Moses,<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title><span style="mso-footnote-id: ftn1; font-size: 12.0pt" class="MsoFootnoteReference"><sup>1</sup></span></a>
pub­lished several years since in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Mason’s
Semi Centennial History of Rochester, </i><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">N.
Y.,</span> John Moses is mentioned as the “son of John Moses who came from
England in 1632, and who is supposed to have been married before he emigrated to
America&quot;…“This John Moses was a blacksmith, and brought with him from
England, in 1632, a set of tools which have remained in the Moses <a name="10"></a> family down to
the present time, a period of two hundred and fifty—two years. <a href="../../Family%20Tree/Rodney%20Jorgensen/Leone%20Moses%20Jorgensen/Jesse%20Tilton%20Moses%20Jr/Jesse%20Tilton%20Moses%20Sr/James%20Moses/10anvil.jpg"> <img border="1" src="10anvil.jpg" align="right" width="347" height="319" lowsrc="10anvil.jpg"></a><o:p>

</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">A
number of the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Iron Age, </i>published
during the Centennial Exposition of 1876, gives a description of an anvil
exhibited at Philadelphia in a building devoted to New England historical
relics. Extracts from this article, printed thirteen years since, are as
follows:<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">&nbsp;</span>“The
old anvil shown in the accompanying illustration has already been described in
these columns, but some additional particulars concern­ing it will be of
interest. It is 11 inches high, 16 inches long to horn, four inches wide, and
weighs 126 pounds. Mr. Seymour says: I assure you It has seen hard service.,
There is no question as to its being made in 1632.’”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">In
the earlier article above alluded to, a letter, dated March 13, 1876, from Mr.
Norman Seymour, Secretary of the Livingston County, N. Y., Historical Society,
is published, from which is quoted: “Among the relics that have been brought
out so far this centennial year, I have found in our town an old anvil, and
marked an it in figures cut in the iron <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">1632.
</i>This anvil was brought over from England about the year 1632 by John
Moses.”<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><a name="11"></a>Farther
on, after tracing from John Moses of 1682 the genealogy of the Schuyler Moses
family (which will be found in later pages of this work), the <i>Iron Age </i>adds:
“The anvil is now at this date in possession of Miss Aurelia Moses, the oldest
daughter of Elisha Moses, Jr., and of Rebecca, the daughter of Elisha Drayton
Moses, who now resides at Mount Morris, Livingston County, N. Y. It is truly an
old relic, and its battered condition proves that it has seen hard service
during nearly 250 years.”<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">The
anvil was, sometime after the Exposition, removed to the residence of the late
Schuyler Moses, at Rochester, N. Y., where the writer has lately examined it,
and verified the above descrip­tion.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">From
a letter from Schuyler Moses to Charles Moses of Brook­lyn, N. Y., dated May
21, 1885, a full copy of which is in the writer’s possession, the following
extract is given: “I have traced the Yankee Moses family back to Plymouth,
Mass., 1632.”<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">In
a letter written several years since to the Rev. Vincent Moses, and kindly
furnished with other material for this history, Schuyler Moses distinctly makes
the statement, that he once had in his possession a record showing that the
first John Moses of his fine was from Plymouth, Mass., and that he came to this
country in 1632.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Marcus
Moses, born 1800, brother of Schuyler, in a letter to Rev. Vincent Moses, April
4,1872, also gives the story of the anvil as handed down from his father and
grandfather. His sister Aurelia Moses, born in 1803, and other members of the
family, also confirm the account.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">The
writer deferred communicating with the late Schuyler Moses, considering that on
account of his great age it would be better to visit him when business should
lead in the direction of Rochester, N. Y. Unfortunately this purpose was too
long delayed, and recent correspondence with his heirs and a personal call at
his late home at Rochester, have not added any fresh par­ticulars to the
foregoing items of family history. The account of the “Moses Anvil&quot; is
given here as it has been handed down through the generations. The researches of
the writer furnish considerable circumstantial evidence in favor of this
tradition of the Mount Morris branch of the Moses family.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">The
Lechford account of John Moses of Plymouth, which will presently follow, was not
published, and the book which contains <a name="12"></a> it was not distributed to the few
principal libraries where it can now be found, until 1886. In the opinion of the
writer its existence is unknown to any of the Moses name besides himself at the
date of this publication. It appears from the Lechford history that John Moses
of Plymouth, though not properly a blacksmith, was a shipwright, and that he
would have had use for an anvil. From what is given hereafter, it will also be
seen that John Moses of Windsor, though not a blacksmith, had ownership in a
cider mill, saw mills, and a gristmill, and had evidently a knowledge of
mechanics. In the inventory of his estate, taken after his death, is enumerated
“iron tools and old iron,” which from the consider­able valuation of £6
and 10s might well have included an anvil.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Without
reference to the anvil, it is clear that in several families the story has been
inherited, that the father of John Moses of Windsor was a John Moses who landed
on the New England coast in 1630 or 1632. These accounts, so carefully handed
down from father to son, gather new force in view of the historical proof lately
obtained by the writer that there was a John Moses of Plymouth, at least as far
back as 1640, although none of those of the family with whom the writer has had
correspondence with reference to the Moses traditions were informed as to his
knowl­edge of such proof, which he purposely withheld, that no bias might be
given through him to their communications. This proof is afforded by the
Lechford historical sketch of John Moses of Plymouth, already referred to, and
which is now given in full.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">In
the transactions of the American Antiquarian Society, Vol. VII, is published a
“Note book kept by Thomas Lechford, Lawyer in Boston, Mass. Bay. from June 27,
1638 to July 21, 1641.” In the preface to the volume, the Rev. Edward Everett
Hale, under date of September 17, 1885, speaks of the Society’s deter­mination
to publish the Note book, and goes on to state that “it is one of the most
valuable documents which have teen preserved, of the history of the first
generation of Massachusetts. It is the daily record of the work done in the
office of the only professional lawyer in the Colony. The present owner of the
original manu­script is Samuel Jennison of Boston . . . I have not been able to
discover the time or place of Lechford's embarkation for New England, nor in
which of the twenty ships which brought 3,000 passengers to Massachusetts in the
summer of 1638, he came. <a name="13"></a> His Note book begins, ' Boston in New England-27-4-the
day of my landing, 1638.’”<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“In
July, 1640,” he wrote to England, “I do profess that I am of this mind and
judgment. I thank God that Christians cannot live happily without Bishops as in
England, nor Englishmen with­out a King.” . . . Of Massachusetts, he writes,
“I am not of them in church or commonweal — some, bid me begone.” . . .<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>On the 16th of November, 1641, after his landing in Eng­land, he writes,
that he “had returned humbly to the Church of England.”<o:p>

a lengthy account is given of this slave-trading venture, and of a law suit

“Stealing negers,” also “chacing the negers (as aforesayde) upon the

is stated that the pinnace was afterward finished and sold to Captain Edward
Gibbons. On page 321 of <i>Prince’s Chronology, </i>under date of October 19,
1630, appears a list<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title><span style="mso-footnote-id: ftn2; font-size: 12.0pt" class="MsoFootnoteReference"><sup>2</sup></span></a>
of 108 persons of the Massachusetts Bay Colony who “desired to be made
freemen,” among them “Edward Gibbons (afterward Major. General).”<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">The
question naturally arises, why this shipyard of John. Moses was not mentioned by
some of the historians of the Plymouth Colony. It must be confessed that this is
somewhat surprising, yet it should be remembered that Duxbury, though but a few
miles from Plymouth across the bay, was, in 1 640, a separate township and had
its own records. Winsor, in his <i>History of Duxbury </i>page 82, says: “It
is greatly to be regretted that the earliest <a name="16"></a> records of Duxbury are lost. We
have evidence that they were burned, as the existing records testify — the
first entry on the leaf of the present records was made in 1666.” It therefore
follows that but for this discovery of the <i>Lechford Manuscript Note Book, </i>and
its publication in 1886, which so strikingly confirms the old time traditions in
the Moses family, we should have had but little actual knowledge of the
shipwright John Moses. It borders on the marvelous that this manuscript and
Governor Bradford’s <i>Manuscript History of Plymouth Colony, </i>should both
have come to light after having. been lost for over two hundred years.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Considering
the record of the law suit, the following deductions may fairly be made. That
John Moses probably had his business established at Duxbury as early as 1639 He
must also have bad more than a merely local reputation, as indicated by the fact
that his first and second order for the pinnace apparently came from Lynn and
Salem. He may have worked as a shipwright at one of these towns. The fact that
there is historical mention of Henry Moses, a mariner (possibly a son), who
married in Salem in 1659, is corroborative of this deduction.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">He
must almost inevitably have been a settled man of middle age, to have learned is

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">The
fact that he employed Thomas Lechford, “the only lawyer of the Colony,”
(Massachusetts Bay Colony), whose practice was discouraged and occasionally
stopped by the Puritans,<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title><span style="mso-footnote-id: ftn3; font-size: 12.0pt" class="MsoFootnoteReference"><sup>3</sup></span></a>
who hated him for his adherence to the Church of England, would, considering the
times, give a fair inference that John Moses did not share in the Puritan
dislike of Lechford or of his religious views. A read­ing of Lechford’s book
will confirm this inference.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">There
is nothing in the papers presented to the court or in any records now extant to
show exactly where the John Moses ship­yard was located. From the local
histories, it seems extremely probable that he must have bought or rented from
one of the original proprietors, perhaps from Philip Delano, mentioned in the
lawsuit, whose land in Duxbury we find described in <i>Plymouth</i> <i><a name="17"></a>Colony<sup>
</sup>Records</i></span><span style="font-size:12.0pt"> Vol. I, p. 67, as
bounded on the mouth side by the lands of John Alden, and on the east side by
the sea.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">In
<i>Winsor’s History of Duxbury </i>a reference is made to Ralph Chapman,
another ship carpenter, who might possibly have worked with John Moses on the
pinnace, as it s almost certain that assistance must have been needed at some
stage of the work. Chapman is mentioned as early as 1640, when he had a grant of
“4 acres at Stoney Brook,” and also, “more land to the north, towards
Green’s 1{arbor” John Josselyn, in his <i>“Account of Two Voyages to New
England in the Year loss,” </i>states that there is “excellent timber for
shipping at Green’s Harbor to eastward of Plymouth.” So far as appears from
the records of Plymouth Colony, their only ship wrights, up to the year 1660,
may have been John Moses and Ralph Chapman. It is highly probable that John
Moses did not come to New England to escape religious persecu­tion, but rather
to fill a demand for men who could build ships. It is certain that as far back
as the time of this lawsuit the ship­building industry was a prominent one in
New England, and that for several years previously it had been largely carried
on by the Massachusetts Bay Colony, a very short distance to the north of
Plymouth. If John Moses came to this country as far back as 1630 or 1632, it is
in every way probable that he worked at the ship-yards of Lynn or Salem or other
of the Massachusetts Bay ports, before going to Plymouth; and this would further
appear from the fact that little ship-building was carried on at Plymouth, and
that no mention is made of the sending over of John Moses or Ralph Chapman in
the voluminous correspondence of the English Council, or of the partners in the
Plymouth Colony Adventure.<o:p>

the same volume, at a date in 1647, appears a list (which is unexplained) of 72
persons; 10 of the names are marked “absent,”— among the absentees —
“John Moses.”<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">From
the foregoing it may be assumed that the shipwright had taken up his domicil in
Plymouth at some time previous to 1646.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">A
careful examination of the volume just quoted, covering all, township
proceedings from 1636 to 1705, will almost inevitably lead to the conclusion
that John Moses must have carried on his occupation outside the township proper
of Plymouth — perhaps across the bay at Duxbury, or Green’s Harbor. In
Plymouth town­ship records are found grants of land to numerous inhabitants;
also on pages 116 to 118 are enumerated taxes against every per­son having a
trade or occupation, with no mention of “John Moses.” Nor is there a mention
of any ship or boat builder in all of the minute proceedings recorded during the
period named.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">In
the same volume appears a list which is apparently under date of 1668 and has
this heading: “The names of such as have voated in Towne meeting in the Towne
of Plymouth.&quot; Ninety-eight names are given, among them, &quot;John
Moses.&quot;<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Somewhat
strangely, under date of February 15, 1668, appears the following:<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">&quot;The

formerly called and had voated in Town meeting and established such as were

found to be Townsmen of Plymouth according to the above said order which Relates
unto the time of the establish­ment of the Towne of Plymouth and the bounds
thereof sett by the court which was in the yeare 1640”<o:p>
</o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Then
follows 68 names, John Moses not among them.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">In
an unconnected list of townsmen of the date of May, 1676, ‘are 82 names, and
among them “John Moses.”<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">In
the preface to the volume it is stated that in some instances “entries have
not been made in chronological order;” ... that in “some instances sheets
were probably copied and entered wherever in any part of the original volume
there was sufficient blank space”<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Turning
now to the Colony Records of Plymouth, in 12 large volumes, by Shurtleff and
Pulsifer, we find in Vol. III, in the <a name="20"></a> “presentments by the Court,” under
date of Oct 5, 1652: “We present James Cole of Plymouth, for entertaining
townsmen in his house contrary to the order of the Court.”<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“We
present Thomas Clarke and John Moses of Plymouth, for staying and drinking at
James Coles’ contrary to the order of the Court.&quot;<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">A
verdict of “acquittal” was rendered on both presentments. From which we
infer that our shipwright was of a somewhat convivial turn, and was perhaps not
strictly a Puritan <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">On
page 30 of same volume it is stated that at a term of the General Court, on June
7, 1653, “Surveyors of the Hiewaies” were appointed for Duxborough,
Plymouth, and other towns, —three surveyors for each town, and that the
surveyors for Plymouth were; &quot;John Moses, Christopher Winter, and Thomas
Morton.&quot;<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">In
Plymouth Colony Records, Vol. VIII, p. 181, is mentioned: “Such of the towne
of Plymouth as have taken the oath of Fidelitie in the year 1657 &quot;— 23
persons, — among them “John Moses.”<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">According
to Winsor’s History of Duxbury he must have become a member of one of the
churches of the Colony in order to have been admitted a freeman. &quot;Lechford's
Plain Dealing,” page 83: “Every freeman when he is admitted takes a strict
oath to be true to the society or jurisdiction.”<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Quite
possibly this “taking of the oath” was in some way con­nected with a new
policy adopted by the Plymouth Colony in 1657. Commencing with that year, and
continuing for several years, fines were imposed “for refusing to take the
oath of fidelitie.” The Plymouth Colony Records show that in two years, 1658
to 1660, forty-eight persons were fined for this refusal, the most of them 10
pounds each. Vol. VIII, p. 95: “For absenting themselves from the public
worship of God” twelve persons were on March 1, 1658, fined 10 shillings each.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">In
Vol. III, p. 196, of the Plymouth Colony Records, is given the verdict, on July
15, 1660, of a jury “conserning the sudden death of James Pierse of Boston,
late deceased.” The verdict rendered was, that “he was struck by thunder and
lightning in a boate in Plymouth Harbor.?’ “John Moses” was one of the
twelve jury-men.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">The
changed condition of John Moses’ church relations does not appear to have
greatly modified his social tendencies. Page 222 recites that on June 10, 1661,
“Gyles Packard, Senior, for <a name="21"></a>suffering men to drink in his house, fyned 10
shillings. John Moses, for being drunke the second time, fined 10 shillings.”<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">As
the most trifling offences were carefully noted in the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Plymouth
Colony Records, </i>and as the old shipwright appears but twice before the
court, we must conclude that his lapses were not frequent.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">The
last mention in the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:

223 of the same volume, where he appears on July 23, 1661, to have been
“summoned by Mr. John Alden, Assistant to the Governor, as the foreman of a
jury of twelve men ‘concerning the sudden death of John Bond of
Plymouth.’”<o:p>

VIII of the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Plymouth Colony Records </i>is
principally filled with lists of births and marriages. Very few deaths appear.
There is no record of the death of John Moses, or of births of children bearing
the name of Moses, from which it is evident that John Moses had no children
after his settlement in Plymouth Colony, which appears to have been at some time
prior to 1640.</span></p>
