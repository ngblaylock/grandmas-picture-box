</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">The
publication of an ancestral record has become an event of such frequent
occurrence as to hardly call for excuse or comment A few words of explanation
will therefore suffice as my preface.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Several
years since, while on a business trip to Hartford, Conn., I examined the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">History
of Simsbury, Granby, and Canton, Conn., </i>pub­lished in 1845, by Noah A.
Phelps, and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Sketches of West Simsbury, </i>published
in 1856, by. Abiel Brown. I found in these histories my own family tree, with
but one omission, which I afterwards supplied from the probate office at
Hartford. My attention was forcibly called to the rapidly approaching decay and
obliteration of many of the earlier manuscript town records of the colonial
period, and I realized that any further searches I might wish to make, for
personal details concerning the “early fathers,” should be prose­cuted at
once. I have since carried out a resolution then formed to gather every
attainable item which would throw any light on the life and pursuits of men of
the first and second generations of the New England family bearing the Moses
name. The results have been so fruitful that I have decided to preserve them in
book form. Incidental to these researches I have obtained the names of many
descendants. I therefore append a genealogical record, which, though not
complete, should give to nearly all who claim New England descent and who can
trace back their ancestry for four generations, an opportunity to establish
their lineage.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Many
of the descendants of the forefathers will doubtless feel disappointed that I
have not made search for them and placed them where they justly belong with the
modem names in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">this </i>book.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">I
can only say by way of apology for omissions and imperfec­tions, that I have
been but two years in gathering material, and have been able to give to this
compilation no more than the occasional spare hours of an active business life.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">I
print this work for my personal satisfaction and also with the hope of
gratifying the few friends and correspondents who have aided in the researches
necessary to such an undertaking — who realize its difficulties, and have with
myself found interest and pleasure in overcoming them.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Among
others who have assisted me, I make especial mention of Rev. Vincent Moses of
Patten, Maine; of Joshua Moses of Hoopes­ton, Ill., and of the Hon. Charles J.
Hoadly, State Librarian at Hartford, Conn., from each of whom I have received
valuable material.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">The
book is published for private circulation.<o:p>
