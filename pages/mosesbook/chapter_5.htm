</span>In searching the earliest records of the sparsely settled 'New England of
1640 to 1650, we find the uncommon name of John Moses making its appearance
about the same time in different colonies, and naturally the theory is evolved
that the two men bearing the same name must have been closely related. It will
be seen, however, from the facts and circumstances that herein follow, that it
is extremely improbable that they were of the same family. John Moses of
Plymouth was by tradition a Welshman, was a shipwright, and was apparently a
Churchman among Puritans; while John Moses of Portsmouth was a scotchman, an
agricul­turalist, and a Puritan among Churchmen. For a better under­standing
of the general surroundings connected with the founder of the New Hampshire
branch, historical quotations are given:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">From
Brewster's <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><span style="letter-spacing:.3pt">Rambles
About Portsmouth </span></i>it appears that Portsmouth was first settled in 1623
by the Laconia Company, and that the &quot;most interested and active men of the
Company were Sir Ferd. Gorges and John Mason.&quot; That a &quot; Manor
house&quot; was erected at &quot; Odiornes Point,&quot; that between &quot;
three and four thou­sand acres &quot; were &quot; attached to this branch of
the plantation,&quot; and that &quot; the provisions of the grant were ample for
carrying out the idea of the proprietors, which was to establish a Manor here
agreeably to the English custom, the occupants of the land to be held as tenants
by the proprietors of the soil.&quot; The company had agents to manage the
colony, and from Doyle's <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><span style="letter-spacing:.3pt">English
in America </span></i>we learn that, &quot;in 1638, there, were in the Colony
more than 40 horses, 100 cattle, 200 sheep, 54 goats, 22 cannon, 250 small arms,
48 boats for fishing, 50 workmen, and 8 Danes to over­look saw mills and make
potash, also 22 women were among the settlers. . . . also in the inventory, a
set of Church furniture. This makes it likely Mason was a zealous
Anglican.&quot;. . . After the division of territory between Gorges and Mason
and the <a name="94"></a> death of Mason in 1634, &quot; the settlement was now free to shape its
own course. The colonists either elected Williams governor or acquiesced in his
continuance in office.&quot; Five years later it is recorded that <sup>,</sup>Williams
the Governor, Ambrose Gibbons Assist­ant, and 18 others, have built a chapel
and parsonage and endowed them with 50 acres of glebe, and have elected two
church wardens and an incumbent.&quot;<o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">From
Lechford's <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Plain Dealing, </i>published
January 17, 1641:<o:p>

</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">&quot;At
Northam <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">alias </i>Pascattaqua is Master
Larkham pastor. One Mas­ter H. K. (Knowles) was also lately minister there. The
two fell out about baptising children, receiving of members, burial of the dead.
. . And further Master Larkham flying to the Magistrate, Master K. and a
Captaine raised arms. Master K. going before the troope with a Bible upon a
poles top, and he or some of his party giving forth that their side were Scots
and the other English. ... Master K. and the Captaine, their leaders, were fined
£100 apiece which they were not able to pay.&quot;<o:p>

</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">From
what we learn later on in the history of the colony, it is quite probable that
the Scotchman, John Moses, was of Master Knowles' party.<o:p>

</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Through
transfers of the colonial grant, George Cleeve and Richard Tucker claimed and
held a disputed agency and jurisdic. tion over certain lands. Gov. Winslow of
Plymouth writes to Gov. Winthrop of Mass., in 1644: &quot; Rigby has good hap to
light on two of the arrantest known knaves that ever trod the New England Shore
to be his agents in Cleeves and Morton. In 1645, Cleeves was exercising
jurisdiction at Casco.&quot; From <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Portland
in the Past </i>is also quoted: &quot;On June 8, 1637, Gorges gave Cleves a
commission for the letting and settling all or any part of his lands or islands
lying between Cape Elizabeth and the end of Sagadahock River, and so up the main
land 60 miles.&quot;<o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Aaron
Moses and Sarah Moses were children of John Moses. Concerning them and their
descendants, quotations from histories . are given:<span style="mso-tab-count:1">
</span>From Brewster's <span style="letter-spacing:.5pt">Rambles, </span>&quot;Timothy
Waterhouse early in <span style="letter-spacing:.5pt">1700 </span>married a Miss
Moses.&quot; &quot; Ruth, daughter of Henry Sherburne, born in <span style="letter-spacing:.5pt">1660,
</span>married Aaron Moses <span style="letter-spacing:.5pt">1677.&quot; </span>The
original will of the &quot;widow of Aaron Moses,&quot; dated in <span style="letter-spacing:.5pt">1732,
</span>now in the possession of the Moses family at Portsmouth, and personally
examined by the writer, shows that her name was <sup>&quot;</sup>Mary,&quot; and
that she had married for a second husband John Sherburne. The <span style="letter-spacing:.5pt">New
England Hist. and Gen. Register, Vol. XVII, p. 253, </span>states that &quot;
Ruth Sherburne married Aaron Moses of N. H., June <span style="letter-spacing:.5pt">1,
1676;&quot; </span>also another history uses the same language, evidently taken
from some record. There is no other conflicting entry show­ing the marriage of
a Ruth Sherburne, while we find that Ruth's sister Mary married a Richard Sloper.
Furthermore, the John Sherburne who married the widow Moses was a brother of
Ruth and Mary Sherburne.<span style="mso-tab-count:1"> </span>From the record,
it may be assumed that Aaron married first, Ruth, a daughter of Henry Sherburne,
and from the will of his widow, we infer that he had a second wife named Mary,
family name unknown. A grandchild of Aaron was named Ruth. Brewster mentions
that Henry Sherburne was de­scended from a noble family in England and came to
Portsmouth in <span style="letter-spacing:.5pt">1631, </span>and on page <span style="letter-spacing:
.5pt">55 </span>of his <span style="letter-spacing:.5pt">Rambles About
Portsmouth </span>he states as follows: &quot;Henry Sherburne of Pascataway may
have been a papist; he was church warden of our Church of England Chapel in <span style="letter-spacing:.5pt">1640;
</span>is spoken of by Winthrop, in the only document left of the town records
burnt by the Bay Puritans in the civil wars, when the church was broken up and
they re-annexed Maine and New Hampshire to their empire. It would look as if he
turned Puritan in the civil wars and went to meeting, and wouldn't again after
the king was brought back.&quot; On page <span style="letter-spacing:.5pt">161 </span>is
given a list of the taxpayers of <span style="letter-spacing:.5pt">1727, </span>among
whom are James Moses, Mark Moses, Josiah Moses, and Joseph Moses. On page <span style="letter-spacing:

was commissioned by the British Government to build a ship of war of 50 guns,
called the <span style="letter-spacing:.3pt">America. </span>The ship was built

12.0pt">In passing through Portsmouth on a business trip in <span style="letter-spacing:.3pt">1889,
</span>the writer visited the old homestead of the Moses family. It is located
near the suburbs of the city on the Sagamore Creek, and can only be reached by a
private road. The original &quot;ancestral acres&quot; are yet in
the Moses family. Apart of the original farm is owned by William Moses, aged <span style="letter-spacing:.3pt">82,
</span>whose house was burned in <span style="letter-spacing:.3pt">1884. </span>The
home of the first John Moses and the greater part of the first farm is now
occupied by Martha J. Moses and her nephew, William E. Rand and family. Every
deed and will, even the certificate of the first survey of the land, is in the
possession of the famil<a href="../../Family%20Tree/Rodney%20Jorgensen/Leone%20Moses%20Jorgensen/Jesse%20Tilton%20Moses%20Jr/Jesse%20Tilton%20Moses%20Sr/James%20Moses/98homestead.jpg"><img border="1" src="98homestead.jpg" align="right" width="598" height="386"></a>y. The present house, though quite old, is the third over
the original cellar. Although so near the city, it is located in a secluded
and picturesque spot. It has been handed down in direct line in the Moses family
from John Moses, who is mentioned in the deed of Cleeves and Tucker in <span style="letter-spacing:.3pt">1646,
</span>as then located at Portsmouth.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
writer believes that, except in the neighborhood of Portsmouth, there are very
few instances in the United States where a property<a name="98"></a> <span style="letter-spacing:.1pt"><a name="99"></a>has
remained continuously in the family name and been occupied by direct descendants
of the first proprietor for 244 years. The his­torical associations of the
place and natural beauty of the spot suggested to him the idea of a photograph
of the old Moses home­stead on the Sagamore, which he had taken and which is
here reproduced. The gigantic old oak beneath whic</span><span style="letter-spacing:.1pt">h the children of so many
generations have played, the grassy slopes, and a rocky bluff overhanging the
water, are especial features, and are sure to make a strong and lasting
impression on any pilgrim Moses who looks upon the home selected by the first of
the New Hampshire line of the Moses name.<o:p>
