<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">A
CONNECTING CHAPTER OF HISTORY.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is a part of the plan of
this little work to give to the founders of the New England families of the
Moses name an environment of history that will fit into, and with, the few
personal items that can be gleaned from the records.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">It
is stated in the opening sentence of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Phelps’
History of Simsbury </i>that “most of the inhabitants of Windsor left England
in 1630, resided in Dorchester until 1635, from whence they moved to Windsor.”<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">A
very detailed history of Dorchester has been published by the Antiquarian
Society of the town, in which probably more than a thousand names are given of
early settlers, including most of those found afterward in Windsor; but nowhere
is mention made of John Moses. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Matthew
Grant’s Record, made in </i>1677, published in appendix of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Stiles’
History of Windsor, </i>is also strong evidence that John Moses did not come
from Dorchester. It would therefore seem to follow that the town of Windsor must
have had other settlers. Let us see.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Both
Stiles and Brown, in their published histories, give Plymouth, and even
Mayflower ancestry to the Brown family of Windsor, and there is every reason to
think that others of the early settlers on the Connecticut were from Plymouth.
The Rev. Nathhniel Chauncey, the “colleague” of the Rev. Mr. Warham, was
“born in Plymouth about 1639.”<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">From
<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Prince, </i>page 433, under date of 1633,
is quoted: “Those of Plymouth are the first English that both discovered this
place and built the same. . . . We have a great new bark and a frame of a house
with boards, nails, etc., ready . . . coming to our place since called
Windsor.”<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">From
Governor Bradford’s <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">History of Plymouth: </i>“On the 8th of June, 1633, the Dutch
completed a fort named the ‘Good Hope’ <a name="23"></a> about the place of the present town
of Hartford.” On passing the fort with the bark, Bradford goes on to relate
that —<o:p>

</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“The
Dutch demanded what they intended.” … “They bid them strike and stay or
else they would shoot them, and stood by their ordnance ready fitted.” “They
answered they had commission from ye Gov. of Plimoth to goe up ye river to such
a place, and if they did shoote they must obey their order, and proceeded.”
Coming to their place (on the site of the present town of Windsor) “they clapt
up their house quickly,” … “and palisadoed their house aboute.”</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt">&nbsp;<o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Plymouth
House — This house stood about two miles southeast of the 1st Congregational
Church on the river bank, about twenty rods from a point of land extending down
the river near the western shore. It was at the place that the Farmington or
Windsor river entered the Connecticut. The mouth of the river is now about 60
rods above. The meadow lying in the vicinity of where the house stood is now
called Plymouth Meadow. … “ 1634. “A party of 70 men, Dutch, under arms
with banners displayed, assaulted the Plymouth House, but they found it so well
forti­fied, and the men who kept it so vigilant and determined, that it could
not be taken without bloodshed. They therefore came to a parley, and finally
returned in peace.”&nbsp;<o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">From
Doyle, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">“The English in America,” </i>page

</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“In
July, 1635, Bradford received a letter from Jonathan Brewster, who was at the
head of the Plymouth settlers on the Connecticut, telling of the intrusion”
(of the Massachusetts Bay settlers). “He would not apparently have objected to
the occupation of vacant territory by the new corners, but they had specially
set their affections on the very spot which the Plymouth Government had bought
from the Mohicans, and had held so manfully against the Dutch. The difficulty,
it is clear, was mainly caused by the emigrants from Dorchester.”</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">From
Jonathan Brewster’s letter is also quoted:&nbsp;<o:p>

was your will we should use their persons and messenger kindly, &amp; so we have
done &amp; do daily to your great charge, for the first com­pany had well nigh
starved, had it not been for this house, for want of victuals.”&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">We
quote again from Doyle:&nbsp;<o:p>

</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; … “The emigrants from
Plymouth protested against the aggres­sion. They finally accepted a compromise.
They were to retain their house, with two parcels of land, making 1/16 of the
tract purchased from the Indians <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:

compensated.” &nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><a name="24"></a>Bradford
states, “But the unkindness was not moon forgotten;” and on page 348:&nbsp;<o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“This
yeare (1636) two shallops going to Coonigtecutt with goods from ye Massachusetts
of such as removed hither to plant, were cast away; … afterwards another boate
of theirs going thither, likewise was cast away, and such goods as came ashore
were preserved for them. Such crosses they mette with in their beginnings which
some imputed as a cor­rection from God for their intrution (to ye wrong of
others into ye place). But I dare not be bould with God’s judgments in this
kind.”&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Doyle,
in his “English in America,” states that in “1636 “Fresh outrages by the
Indians had been committed on the Con­necticut and on a trading vessel from
Plymouth.”<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Enough
has been quoted in the foregoing to serve the purposes of this chapter, which is
to show, that although Windsor may be said to have been settled from Dorchester,
still it had some years previously been visited by pioneers from the more
adventuresome Plymouth Colony, who had made a foothold if not a permanent
lodgment. It was the “far West” of the New England of 1640 to 1650. What
more likely than that the young and hardy spirits of Plymouth should seek their
fortune there.</span></p>
