<p><u>Smoke in the Granary</u></p>

<p>Grandpa: We got down in that old broken tin granary and built
a fire.</p>

<p>Linda: In the granary?</p>

<p>Grandpa: Yeah, yeah, yes sir. Then, we smoked all those dukes
on some sacks . . . tried to put the fire out. There was lots of
smoke. By then, I couldn&#146;t see. By then, we got great big
green flames under that granary. The wind took it. . . . the fire
. . . The smoke was so bad; . . . By then I was so sick I didn&#146;t
care. And that guy, he wasn&#146;t very religious, anyway. He
said, &quot;can you pray.&quot; I said, &quot;I don&#146;t know
if I can or not,&quot; He said, &quot;Be quiet, I will.&quot;
&quot;We better start praying,&quot; he says. &quot;We gotta put
that fire out or I&#146;ll get a whippen.&quot; So I said, &quot;How
are we going to do it?&quot; &quot;Throw dirt on it,&quot; he
said. Well, we had it right in the middle of a rock pile. So we
threw the rocks on it. And it didn&#146;t put the fire out. So he
said, &quot;We&#146;ll run down the hill (to get some dirt).&quot;
Oh, which pretty near the length of this building (the Elks
Hospital). We had to run fast to get it out. . . . It burnt
faster. Oh boy!</p>

<p>Linda: Did you get the fire out?</p>

<p>Grandpa: No, we didn&#146;t. Harvey Simons was over there
working his grass line and he looked up and he said, &quot;Hey
you guys&#150;put that fire out.&quot; . . . And there we sat.
&quot;Well, we gotta get this fire out, . . . bags of . . . and
here comes Harvey Simons.&quot; And I shout, &quot;If Dad&#146;s
doesn&#146;t whip me this time for this misdemeanor I&#146;d
never smoke it again,&quot; and I didn&#146;t. He didn&#146;t
whip me and I didn&#146;t smoke no more of this foolishness.</p>

<p><u>Moonshine</u></p>

<p>I went with those boys downtown one night. And they had this
moonshine. They got a couple of bottle of it. They wanted me to
drink with them. I told them I don&#146;t want to drink that
garbage. You go ahead and drink it and they did and they got
drunk. They were drunk. . . . hung around there they were lazy.
There you know&#150;they were truing to sober up so they dared to
go home. I finally I took off and went home. And left them.</p>

<p>Mom said, &quot;Where have you been?&quot; when I came in. I
said I went with the boys downtown &#150; mom said what did you
do? Well, I knew right then I&#146;d have to tell her. I said,
well they had some moonshine . . . I says well, I didn&#146;t
drink any but the rest of them did and they are pretty souped up.
I said, I didn&#146;t want to stay around there while they
sobered up so I came home. Mom told Carlyn and Berdise and they
went down and told all the mothers of those kids that their kids
had been on a bender. And the they were going to beat me up for
telling on them. </p>

<p>Bryce: If you didn&#146;t get it one way you got it another.</p>

<p>Grandpa: I told them right out, I says, you guy know you are
doing wrong so what do you want to beat me up for. You knew
better. The kind of cooled down and didn&#146;t beat me up. I
didn&#146;t go fool with them anymore. Because they wanted to
drink and go crazy like that they could do it all by themselves.
So I got very unpopular. </p>

<p>I didn&#146;t like what they were doing to all the girls in
the ward anyway. There wasn&#146;t a one of them down there they
didn&#146;t play with or whatever you call it.</p>

<p>And I said well, I don&#146;t want any of them anyway &#150;
they are second handed. So I wouldn&#146;t go with them and they
kept messing with them and finally they went off to Wellsville
and found them a wife and left the home kids high and dry &#150;
and I didn&#146;t think that was good either. I finally moved
away and ended up in Riverside and that&#146;s where Mom was, so
I married her.</p>

<p><u>1</u><sup><u>st</u></sup><u> Job</u></p>

<p>First job pitching tater bags. Handle very good. 68 cents an
hour. And I thought I was doing good. </p>

<p>Linda: It was in those days.</p>

<p>Grandpa: Boy, I well we could pay our bills and that&#146;s
about all. With what we got paid.</p>

<p>How soon was it after you got married that you we to Arco and
broke that land out of Sagebrush.</p>

<p>Grandpa: Well, we went up there the first year we were married
and that was 1941. Spring of 1941 we went up there and worked
with Wilkee Noble that summer and well between Wilkee and me we
got grandpa Moses 80 acres planted and for the next year we moved
back to Riverside for the winter. Next year we moved up there in
that old ram shock of a house. Jesse T came up there with Bings,
storming around with little faith that we would get it fixed. So
we got one room fixed and moved in. And that was the end of Jesse
T. He took off and left me to fix the rest of it. So we plastered
and patched the holes in the the bedroom, then we had two rooms
done and we fixed up another room and we had three rooms. And
that was as far as I got. We bought the 40 then so we decided we&#146;d
ren grandpa Moses place one more year and live there and live
there and farm the 40 and I&#146;ll be damed if grandpa didn&#146;t
sell it out from under us. And left us hight and driy. No house
to live in and no nothing. The 40 acres we bought had a one-room.</p>

<p>We were all in that one room and I told Leone, I said, &quot;we
can&#146;t go on much longer. We can&#146;t live here like this
all summer and that was in the spring. I went over to Wilkee and
he had a bunch of old beat up cinder blocks. I told him if he
would let me use them I would build my house and then in the fall
I would replace them when it. .. In the fall when we got that
trade done and went down to Boise Payette lumber, only it was in
Arco. I knew that guy pretty well and he loaned me about $1,500
worth of credit on lumber and stuff and we built that house on
the highway. So between that we had about $5,000 in that shock
when we got it done. But it was so warm. Wind and snow blowing in
the wintertime inside there you couldn&#146;t tell if it was
whistling or what. We had that warm mouning stove and we could
fill that thing full at night and it would burn all night and
half the next day and we never got cold in that building. I had
it insulated on top 6 inches.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>THIS IS A PAGE OUT OF ORDER:</p>

<p>I bought a real killer diller from that sucker old &quot;run
away at the drop of a hat.&quot; I hooked him up one day and
Brownie together and that was a mistake.</p>

<p>NEW PAGE:</p>

<p>Its about supposed to be 6 inches of insulation in these . . .
about that many . . . we put over them we went up there and put
some more on top. We put white pine on the ceiling and we didn&#146;t
like that so we plastered over the top of it. It was really a
pretty warm houme with cinder blocks all the way around. It didn&#146;t
take much to heat that thing. It the best &#150; the really the
best home we&#146;ve ever had except for we built it for a garage.</p>

<p>I ... one two three four rooms and a bathroom and the kitchen
was last the living south bathroom outside door was right there.
You walked in that doorway and was in the living or the Kitchen.
The kitchen was here and the livingroom and you could go either
way. Most the time we headed for the kitchen cause thats where
the food was.</p>

<p><u>Horses</u></p>

<p>Bryce: Didn&#146;t you have a team of horses when you broke
that land down?</p>

<p>Grandpa: 6 head of horses - Chub and Browny. I can&#146;t
remember what I called the Chub one, that dirty one.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><u>Notes</u></p>

<p>Remember 5 more waffles.</p>

<p>Dad and Levi and Leon and two girls were going to Bear Lake.
We left early to get a good start when we got into twon we
stopped to get something to eat. We went into a restarant and
order some waffles. The were hugh and we. When we got them eaten,
Dad ordered 5 more. There were so sick they upchucked on the way
to Bear Lake.</p>

<p>Dad tells the time he dove into the water and it was only a
foot deep. He skinned his nose and chest.</p>

<p>Dad&#146;s egg allowance. Dad used to get and egg a week and
would take it to the store and trade it in on a big candy bar
called Big Daddy. And when the chicken&#146;s didn&#146;t lay
enough we didn&#146;t get anything.</p>

<p>On the fourth of July, we got a nickle and we were told not to
spend it all in one place. </p>

<p>We walked everywhere we went. When we went to school we took
our lunch for the whole family wrapped in newspaper, tied in a
string. When it was lunch time the whole family would gather
together to eat lunch.</p>

<p>Dad went out to get on Happy their family pony. He was going
to show aunt Amy how Tom Micks rode his horse. The minute dad hit
the saddle, the pony took off straight for the close line, swept
him off and left him on his rear.</p>

<p><u>Mustang Story in Nevada with my Dad</u></p>

<p>My grandpa and Uncle Merv, Uncle Orin and Dad would go to
Nevada to round up wild mustangs and bring them to Hyde Park and
green break them and sell them to people in town for work horses.
They would sell them in teams for about 500 a team. One by one
people started buying tractors and that ended the horse deal.</p>

<p>My mother would catch me out there peeking in the corrals and
would be scared to death. I was just a little kid then. </p>

<p>Hyde Park, Dad and I was sawing the tree down cutting down the
poplar tree. Uncle Darrel and Uncle Mervin were holding the rope.
They got the tree swaying. When the tree was ready, Uncle Darrell
went one way and Uncle Mervin the other and the tree caught Uncle
Merv.</p>

<p>Apple Valley, Lolanne starting the D.C. case. The tractor was
new. </p>

<p>Lolanne running the SC tractor over the hill.</p>

<p>Hyde Park, An incident with the pine hen. I went walked up the
ridge all alone to the ridge to poach a pine hen. I got all the
way up to the ridge and didn&#146;t see a pine hen (there was a
skiff of snow). So I turned around and in my tracks I saw the
biggest Mountain Lion tracks I ever saw. He jumped off the trail
and into the bushes. I got off the Mountain as fast as I could
and didn&#146;t feel good until I passes through the gate on
Cedar Hill. The cat had followed me 400 feet and I didn&#146;t
know it. I lost all interest in poaching Pine Hens. Pine Hens
should stand there and let you shoot them. If you missed they
would let you shoot again. I got out in the open away from trees
and ran as fast as I could.</p>

<p>When I went to get my blessing I had a queer sensation I never
forgot. I haven&#146;t told many people. I went to Harvey Session
place in Logan. I rode the pony down and tied her up to a tree. I
went in and he set me up on a stool. It was so high I set my feet
on a ring. The minute he started that blessing it felt like we
were carried away on a high pinicle. It was scary. Whe it was all
over he said &quot;amen&quot; and I felt like we were in the room
again.</p>

<p><u>Saturday Night Baths</u></p>

<p>When we were kids we would start with the little one first and
then we would add hot water to the tub when it got cold so we
wouldn&#146;t have to pack the water. The bigger kids would pack
their own water so they wouldn&#146;t have to bathe in the other
kids water.</p>

<p>We bathed in the kitchen in the galvanized tub next to the
stove and put wood in the stove to make it warmer. We each had
our own towel. We used regular hand soap to take a bath but mom
made home-made soap to wash clothes with.</p>

<p>Everytime we killed a pig or cow we saved the fat and rendered
it out and made soap.</p>

<p>Kids in the family. I was number six. Levi no. 7. Cleon no. 8.
Norma 9. Arland Cle__ died a month after he was born with
pnemonia. </p>

<p>Venda 1, Berdice 2, Carlyn 3, Lyda 4, Arda 5, Dad 6, Levi 7,
Cleon 8, Norma 9 &#150; </p>

<p>I was born up on the hill in Hyde Park and lived there until I
left home and came to Idaho at 24. I worked a winter for Bert
Cutforth in Blackfoot, (Riverside</p>

<p><u>The Elks</u></p>

<p>I go to bed at 8:00 and don&#146;t get up until 6:30. I have
real tired hips before the night is over.</p>

<p><u>Impressions from Bryce &#150; March 1988</u></p>

<p>As a very young boy my first impressions of my father was that
he was a warm and loving person. Dad was always willing to take
Rod and I with him everwhere he went. That is why I can remember
catching trout in the irrigation ditch with a shovel. I can
remember standing on the wagon holding to the reins of our team
during thrashing time as Dad would walk along throwing the shucks
of grain with his fork. I remember the thrill when the team got
the chich chich they would walk forward until Dad would &quot;woa&quot;
them down. We really thought we were driving and it was a thrill.
When dad bought his first farm, all he would let us stand between
his legs and hang on to the steering wheel. During mowing time as
the hay fell behind the cutter bar and I would jog along and at
times we would stop, bunch the hay up and jump on it. Now, even
during winter time, I can still smell the freshly mown hay. I
remember ghow great it was to grab his hand when he would throw
his shovel over his shoulder go to irrigate. I remember how long
his stride was and hoped someday I could stride like he had. One
really special memory from thanksgiving and Christmas was that
Dad would sing or from Christmas carols or Church hymns. Even at
other times you could hear him singing a happy tune. I used to
think that&#146;s why Dad went to Church, so he could sing to us
on the way to and from.</p>

<p>My father had very little tolerance for disobedience, and
although he corrected us many times, he still had the ability to
give us warmth and love. One day dad went to caldwell to see the
FmhA, while he was done I was suppose to mow hay. I mowed about 5
minutes of that whole afternoon and when Dad arrived home and
found not only the mowing undone and also the mower broke down he
was furious. He took the pitman stick or what was left and broke
it again over my backside. I was very stunned over the whole
affair and I can still remember how sorrowful I was about letting
my father down by not following through with my job.</p>

<p>I remember many experiences working on projects with my Dad or
uncle Levi. My father always had a project of some sort or other.
Leveling land, building on the house, picking spuds or corn,
shoveling ditch, building a beet cultavator, and many, many other.
Our chance to slip away into idleness was very slim. I can even
remember working till two in the morning to repair a clutch or
the truck so we would have it back into the corn field the next
morning. Later, now that I have boys, I appreciate his ability to
always have something for us to do.</p>
