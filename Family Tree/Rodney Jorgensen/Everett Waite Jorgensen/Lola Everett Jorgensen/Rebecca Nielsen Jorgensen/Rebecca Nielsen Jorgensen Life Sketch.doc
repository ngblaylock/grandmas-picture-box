}{\plain \tab The father of Rebecca Nielsen Jorgensen, Lars L. Nielsen, was born at Agersted Voer 
Sogern, Denmark on October 6, 1830, the year the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints 
was organized. He was a gardener by trade and also worked in a foundry.\par
}{\plain \tab Lars Nielsen's wife, Dorthea Marie Thomasen, was born in Halling Sogen, Denmark on 
February 24, 1838.  As a young woman, she was hired out to help maintain the family. She 
learned to card and spin wool and to weave it into cloth for clothing, blankets and carpets. She 
also learned to knit stockings, mittens and sweaters as well as to take care of the orchard. She 
met her intended husband after they had both joined the Church.  At the time of their meeting, 
Lars Nielsen was a traveling missionary companion of Brother Anthon Lund.\par
}{\plain \tab They were married on October 15, 1860. They were faithful Church members and on 
Sundays would walk a Danish mile, which is equivalent to four English miles, to hear the gospel 
preached. Their family consisted of two girls and two boys; one son Laurtz, died and was buried 
in Aalborg. Rebecca was the oldest of the four children.\par
}{\plain \tab The family left Denmark in July, 1866 in a sailing vessel. They were on the sea for nine 
weeks.  During the trip, Rebecca (five years of age) became lost.  When they finally located her, 
she was walking the railing of the upper deck. Her mother walked up quietly behind her with out 
speaking, fearing she would be lost in the dashing waves below, and took her from the railing.  
Surely her life was saved because her work was not finished on this earth.  When they landed in 
America, they were assigned to Captain Lowry's train of immigrating Saints and arrived in Salt 
Lake City on October 22, 1866. While crossing the plains, cholera claimed many of the saints 
and their youngest son, Tommy was among them. He was buried on the plains leaving only the 
two girls, Rebecca and Annie.\par
}{\plain \tab They left Salt Lake City and arrived in Logan on November 1, 1866 where they spent the 
winter. The following spring they moved to Hyde Park, where they lived for six years. The 
father, Lars, was a good gardener and an especially good hand with the animals and fowls.  He 
taught his daughters the frugal way of living, working in the garden and helping with the duties 
of the home. While living in Hyde Park, a third child, Minnie, died.  She was burned to death.  
This was a severe shock to the family and they were filled with grief.\par
}{\plain \tab Along with other good saints, they moved to Benson Ward and took up a homestead.  
Here they did some real pioneering \_\_ they carried water from Bear River in two buckets hanging 
from a yoke over the shoulders for household needs. She Rebecca learned to herd cattle and 
sheep and while she cared for them she would knit stockings, etc. for family needs. She also 
helped her father cradle wheat and haul hay and learned how to burn grease wood for lye and to 
make soap for family cleaning. She helped to weave cloth out of wool yarn which they sheared, 
washed, dyed and spun.  Clothing was made from the jeans for the men's pants, shirts and coats 
and Lindsey dresses for the women.  Often the skirts were gored, some just gathered to a band.  
The baszues or waists were darted to become form\_fitting, some were trimmed with rare pieces 
of velvet or lace around the neck band and down the front.  These basques usually buttoned 
down the front and Rebecca made beautiful buttonholes. Annie was capable of the duties at 
home so Rebecca was hired out.  She worked for Martha Thain, Ellen Rees, Mary Ann Rogers, 
Sarah Reese, and Sister Harris.  Cash was scarce so $1.50 per week was a good wage and the 
training was excellent.  As well as carry water from the river, she was required to do family 
duties, wash, iron, milk cows and care for the milk.  She became an expert butter maker and 
often sold butter for ten cents a pound,  She learned how to braid rye straw and bleach it with 
sulphur for hats to shade them from the hot sun. Rebecca's skin was fair and it freckled easily. 
Ellen Rees taught her to crochet, embroider and to make cloth slippers.\par
}{\plain \tab When she was fourteen years old, Rebecca's father began to worry fear she would be an 
old maid.  She was so quiet and retiring.  He suggested that she should marry in polygamy as she 
had had many offers. Rebecca stoutly refused.  She knew and felt she would find someone her 
own age.  Her first sweetheart wanted her to marry but he was not her choice.  He stayed single 
until Rebecca was married.  She had other suitors but she wanted none of them until a tall, 
handsomely built young man by the name of Isaac Jorgensen came. She knew immediately he 
was for her.  The romance started and one and a half years later, on July 8, 1880, they were 
married in the Salt Lake Endowment House.  The wedding trip was made in a covered wagon 
accompanied by the groom's sister and her husband.\par
}{\plain \tab Isaac and Rebecca Jorgensen made their home in Logan in the Fourth ward.  They loved 
at 33 East 4}{\plain \super th}{\plain  North between Main and First East Streets,  Eight children were born to them 
while they lived here.  Three of these children died; one boy eleven months old and a pair of 
twin girls five and six weeks old.  In 1890, Isaac became interested in a lumber company in 
Oregon and as a result he moved the family to Baker City, Oregon.  One boy was born there. 
However, his wife was dissatisfied without the church and so the family returned to Logan.  
While in Logan, a baby girl was born.  After about two years in Logan, they sold their home and 
most of the property and purchased land and a home in Hyde Park.  Six more children were born 
in Hyde Park making a family a family of sixteen children \_\_ eight boys and eight girls.  Two of 
the babies born here died at the age of six months and three months.  Eleven of the children grew 
to maturity and were married and raised families. The next to the youngest son, Quin, died of 
Miner's consumption which he contracted while working for the Southern Pacific Railroad.  He 
left a wife and five children.\par
}{\plain \tab Rebecca Jorgensen was very serious about her life's work. She was tender\_hearted and 
thoughtful of others.  She would do her utmost to make others happy and comfortable.  She 
taught her children to pray, to be honest and humble, to respect the aged and those in authority 
over us in the Church. She loved her religion and had great faith in administration of the sick by 
the Elders of the Church. Many times she has been delivered from the hands of death by the 
power of God through the Elders.  At one time, Brother Alma Sonne and Joseph E. Cardon 
administered to her. As Brother Sonne left, he made the remark, "I don't think she can live till 
morning."  She was healed and the next day Brother Sonne said, "If ever a miracle in healing 
was done in our Church, it was that day." She had great faith in the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter\_day Saints although she didn't do much active participation.  Her family was large and her 
health poor which restricted much activity in the Church, but she always saw that the children 
were bathed and ready for Sunday School, Primary and Religion Class or Sacrament Meeting.\par
}{\plain \tab She always had food canned and clothing ready for the winter for her family as well as 
others. She sewed all her children's clothes and everything to keep them warm and. comfortable.  
She gave to the poor, homeless and homebound fruit, honey, soup, cookies, cream, butter, milk, 
eggs, meat, and clothing. She fed and clothed two immigrant boys, and three of her deceased 
cousin\'92s boys until they could provide for themselves.\par
}{\plain \tab She was willing to help her parents and her brothers and sisters with sewing, 
housecleaning, and any other help they needed. Her generosity never gave out.\par
}{\plain \tab In 1909  the family (except for three who were married) moved to Nevada where they 
lived for a year.  Then they moved to Grouse Creek, Utah and back to Logan again. From Logan 
they moved to Smithfield, then to Amalga and finally back to Logan. They were able to adjust 
themselves and made themselves useful at each move.\par
}{\plain \tab Rebecca Nielsen Jorgensen died at 55 East 5}{\plain \super th}{\plain  North, Logan, Utah on March 19, 1930 at 
the age of 69 years. She was a member of the Logan Ninth Ward at the time of her death.\par
