<p>The father of Rebecca Nielsen Jorgensen, Lars L. Nielsen, was
born at Agersted Voer Sogern, Denmark on October 6, 1830, the
year the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was
organized. He was a gardener by trade and also worked in a
foundry.</p>

<p>Lars Nielsen's wife, Dorthea Marie Thomasen, was born in
Halling Sogen, Denmark on February 24, 1838. As a young woman,
she was hired out to help maintain the family. She learned to
card and spin wool and to weave it into cloth for clothing,
blankets and carpets. She also learned to knit stockings, mittens
and sweaters as well as to take care of the orchard. She met her
intended husband after they had both joined the Church. At the
time of their meeting, Lars Nielsen was a traveling missionary
companion of Brother Anthon Lund.</p>

<p>They were married on October 15, 1860. They were faithful
Church members and on Sundays would walk a Danish mile, which is
equivalent to four English miles, to hear the gospel preached.
Their family consisted of two girls and two boys; one son Laurtz,
died and was buried in Aalborg. Rebecca was the oldest of the
four children.</p>

<p>The family left Denmark in July, 1866 in a sailing vessel.
They were on the sea for nine weeks. During the trip, Rebecca (five
years of age) became lost. When they finally located her, she was
walking the railing of the upper deck. Her mother walked up
quietly behind her with out speaking, fearing she would be lost
in the dashing waves below, and took her from the railing. Surely
her life was saved because her work was not finished on this
earth. When they landed in America, they were assigned to Captain
Lowry's train of immigrating Saints and arrived in Salt Lake City
on October 22, 1866. While crossing the plains, cholera claimed
many of the saints and their youngest son, Tommy was among them.
He was buried on the plains leaving only the two girls, Rebecca
and Annie.</p>

<p>They left Salt Lake City and arrived in Logan on November 1,
1866 where they spent the winter. The following spring they moved
to Hyde Park, where they lived for six years. The father, Lars,
was a good gardener and an especially good hand with the animals
and fowls. He taught his daughters the frugal way of living,
working in the garden and helping with the duties of the home.
While living in Hyde Park, a third child, Minnie, died. She was
burned to death. This was a severe shock to the family and they
were filled with grief.</p>

<p>Along with other good saints, they moved to Benson Ward and
took up a homestead. Here they did some real pioneering -- they
carried water from Bear River in two buckets hanging from a yoke
over the shoulders for household needs. She Rebecca learned to
herd cattle and sheep and while she cared for them she would knit
stockings, etc. for family needs. She also helped her father
cradle wheat and haul hay and learned how to burn grease wood for
lye and to make soap for family cleaning. She helped to weave
cloth out of wool yarn which they sheared, washed, dyed and spun.
Clothing was made from the jeans for the men's pants, shirts and
coats and Lindsey dresses for the women. Often the skirts were
gored, some just gathered to a band. The baszues or waists were
darted to become form-fitting, some were trimmed with rare pieces
of velvet or lace around the neck band and down the front. These
basques usually buttoned down the front and Rebecca made
beautiful buttonholes. Annie was capable of the duties at home so
Rebecca was hired out. She worked for Martha Thain, Ellen Rees,
Mary Ann Rogers, Sarah Reese, and Sister Harris. Cash was scarce
so $1.50 per week was a good wage and the training was excellent.
As well as carry water from the river, she was required to do
family duties, wash, iron, milk cows and care for the milk. She
became an expert butter maker and often sold butter for ten cents
a pound, She learned how to braid rye straw and bleach it with
sulphur for hats to shade them from the hot sun. Rebecca's skin
was fair and it freckled easily. Ellen Rees taught her to
crochet, embroider and to make cloth slippers.</p>

<p>When she was fourteen years old, Rebecca's father began to
worry fear she would be an old maid. She was so quiet and
retiring. He suggested that she should marry in polygamy as she
had had many offers. Rebecca stoutly refused. She knew and felt
she would find someone her own age. Her first sweetheart wanted
her to marry but he was not her choice. He stayed single until
Rebecca was married. She had other suitors but she wanted none of
them until a tall, handsomely built young man by the name of
Isaac Jorgensen came. She knew immediately he was for her. The
romance started and one and a half years later, on July 8, 1880,
they were married in the Salt Lake Endowment House. The wedding
trip was made in a covered wagon accompanied by the groom's
sister and her husband.</p>

<p>Isaac and Rebecca Jorgensen made their home in Logan in the
Fourth ward. They loved at 33 East 4<sup>th</sup> North between
Main and First East Streets, Eight children were born to them
while they lived here. Three of these children died; one boy
eleven months old and a pair of twin girls five and six weeks old.
In 1890, Isaac became interested in a lumber company in Oregon
and as a result he moved the family to Baker City, Oregon. One
boy was born there. However, his wife was dissatisfied without
the church and so the family returned to Logan. While in Logan, a
baby girl was born. After about two years in Logan, they sold
their home and most of the property and purchased land and a home
in Hyde Park. Six more children were born in Hyde Park making a
family a family of sixteen children -- eight boys and eight girls.
Two of the babies born here died at the age of six months and
three months. Eleven of the children grew to maturity and were
married and raised families. The next to the youngest son, Quin,
died of Miner's consumption which he contracted while working for
the Southern Pacific Railroad. He left a wife and five children.</p>

<p>Rebecca Jorgensen was very serious about her life's work. She
was tender-hearted and thoughtful of others. She would do her
utmost to make others happy and comfortable. She taught her
children to pray, to be honest and humble, to respect the aged
and those in authority over us in the Church. She loved her
religion and had great faith in administration of the sick by the
Elders of the Church. Many times she has been delivered from the
hands of death by the power of God through the Elders. At one
time, Brother Alma Sonne and Joseph E. Cardon administered to her.
As Brother Sonne left, he made the remark, &quot;I don't think
she can live till morning.&quot; She was healed and the next day
Brother Sonne said, &quot;If ever a miracle in healing was done
in our Church, it was that day.&quot; She had great faith in the
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints although she didn't
do much active participation. Her family was large and her health
poor which restricted much activity in the Church, but she always
saw that the children were bathed and ready for Sunday School,
Primary and Religion Class or Sacrament Meeting.</p>

<p>She always had food canned and clothing ready for the winter
for her family as well as others. She sewed all her children's
clothes and everything to keep them warm and. comfortable. She
gave to the poor, homeless and homebound fruit, honey, soup,
cookies, cream, butter, milk, eggs, meat, and clothing. She fed
and clothed two immigrant boys, and three of her deceased cousin&#146;s
boys until they could provide for themselves.</p>

<p>She was willing to help her parents and her brothers and
sisters with sewing, housecleaning, and any other help they
needed. Her generosity never gave out.</p>

<p>In 1909 the family (except for three who were married) moved
to Nevada where they lived for a year. Then they moved to Grouse
Creek, Utah and back to Logan again. From Logan they moved to
Smithfield, then to Amalga and finally back to Logan. They were
able to adjust themselves and made themselves useful at each move.</p>

<p>Rebecca Nielsen Jorgensen died at 55 East 5<sup>th</sup>
North, Logan, Utah on March 19, 1930 at the age of 69 years. She
was a member of the Logan Ninth Ward at the time of her death.</p>
