}{\plain \tab Dorthea Marie Thomasen Nielsen was born February 24, 1838 in Mollmark Russet, 
Hlmst, Denmark. She was raised in Denmark and when she was seven years of age she was hired 
out as a baby tender for a very small wage.  She did this kind of work until she was twelve years 
old.  At that age she was hired to a family on a large farm.  She worked there for four years as 
this was the custom of the country.  While there she had to do housework, milk the cows 
morning and evenings, do outside work during the day, work on the farm helping the men with 
the farm work.  When her four years were up she thought farm work was too hard, and went to 
work in a factory.  This work took her a long way from home.  She had to go a Danish four 
miles, and their mile is as long as four American miles.  She remained at the factory for five 
years.  Here she learned to make all kinds of cloth, shawls, blankets, carpets, rugs, and all kinds 
of things, While working there her father and mother both passed away.  One of her sisters also 
died leaving she and her three other sisters as orphans.\par
}{\plain \tab It was while working at this factory that she first heard the Latter-day Saint Elders.  The 
girls would attend their meetings at night and on Sunday,  She has said many times it was just 
like food to her to hear the Elders talk.  Her sisters made fun of her for believing what they said, 
but she kept going to hear them.  When she was nineteen years old, she applied for baptism, and 
was baptized January 13th, 1857, and was also confirmed a member of the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter\_Day Saints.\par
}{\plain \tab She remained at the factory until she was twenty\_one years old, when she met her future 
husband, then the Branch President.  One year later she was married to Lars Larsen Nielsen.  She 
left the factory and went with him to live in the Mission Home at Aalborg. While living there 
she had four children. In the spring of 1866 they prepared to immigrate to America, and then to 
Utah.  Meanwhile she lost one of the children, a little boy named Alma, while they were still 
living in Denmark.\par
}{\plain \tab When her baby, named Lauritz, was only three weeks old, they sailed for the United 
States of America, on the 10th day of April, taking their three children with them.  The trip 
across the ocean was a long one, taking nine weeks.  The trip across the plains was also a long 
hard one. Their baby died and was buried on the plains.  They arrived in New York, and left for 
Utah on June 19th, 1866, arriving in Salt Lake City, October 22nd, 1866.  They then went on to 
Logan, Utah arriving on November 9th, staying there until the next spring, (1867), when they 
moved to Hyde Park, Cache County, Utah; While living there they had three more children born 
to them; a girl and two boys.  Also another baby died from scarlet fever, and six weeks later her 
little five year old daughter was burned to death.\par
}{\plain \tab She did not feel that she could stay in Hyde Park any longer, so father took up a 
homestead in 1873 and moved to Benson ward, where four more children were born to them.  
They lived there about ten years, and then moved back to Hyde Park, where they lived the 
remainder of their lives building themselves a new home there.\par
}{\plain \tab They were the parents of eleven children. Mother was a weaver by trade and it was a 
great help to her throughout her life.  She was active in the Church, and with her husband they 
accomplished many things. They did much to relieve the suffering in the community, by 
practical nursing and caring for the sick, giving to the poor and needy, as well as sharing their 
meager supplies with the Indians.  She lived to be 75 years of age.  She passed to the great 
beyond a faithful Latter\_day Saint, and in full fellowship of the Church.  Much more could be 
said of her and what she and her husband and family had to endure during the hardships of the 
Pioneer days.\par
