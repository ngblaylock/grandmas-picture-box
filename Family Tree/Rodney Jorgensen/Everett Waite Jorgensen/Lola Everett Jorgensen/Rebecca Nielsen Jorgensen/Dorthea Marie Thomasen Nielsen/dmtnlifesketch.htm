<p>Dorthea Marie Thomasen Nielsen was born February 24, 1838 in
Mollmark Russet, Hlmst, Denmark. She was raised in Denmark and
when she was seven years of age she was hired out as a baby
tender for a very small wage. She did this kind of work until she
was twelve years old. At that age she was hired to a family on a
large farm. She worked there for four years as this was the
custom of the country. While there she had to do housework, milk
the cows morning and evenings, do outside work during the day,
work on the farm helping the men with the farm work. When her
four years were up she thought farm work was too hard, and went
to work in a factory. This work took her a long way from home.
She had to go a Danish four miles, and their mile is as long as
four American miles. She remained at the factory for five years.
Here she learned to make all kinds of cloth, shawls, blankets,
carpets, rugs, and all kinds of things, While working there her
father and mother both passed away. One of her sisters also died
leaving she and her three other sisters as orphans.</p>

<p>It was while working at this factory that she first heard the
Latter-day Saint Elders. The girls would attend their meetings at
night and on Sunday, She has said many times it was just like
food to her to hear the Elders talk. Her sisters made fun of her
for believing what they said, but she kept going to hear them.
When she was nineteen years old, she applied for baptism, and was
baptized January 13th, 1857, and was also confirmed a member of
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.</p>

<p>She remained at the factory until she was twenty-one years
old, when she met her future husband, then the Branch President.
One year later she was married to Lars Larsen Nielsen. She left
the factory and went with him to live in the Mission Home at
Aalborg. While living there she had four children. In the spring
of 1866 they prepared to immigrate to America, and then to Utah.
Meanwhile she lost one of the children, a little boy named Alma,
while they were still living in Denmark.</p>

<p>When her baby, named Lauritz, was only three weeks old, they
sailed for the United States of America, on the 10th day of
April, taking their three children with them. The trip across the
ocean was a long one, taking nine weeks. The trip across the
plains was also a long hard one. Their baby died and was buried
on the plains. They arrived in New York, and left for Utah on
June 19th, 1866, arriving in Salt Lake City, October 22nd, 1866.
They then went on to Logan, Utah arriving on November 9th,
staying there until the next spring, (1867), when they moved to
Hyde Park, Cache County, Utah; While living there they had three
more children born to them; a girl and two boys. Also another
baby died from scarlet fever, and six weeks later her little five
year old daughter was burned to death.</p>

<p>She did not feel that she could stay in Hyde Park any longer,
so father took up a homestead in 1873 and moved to Benson ward,
where four more children were born to them. They lived there
about ten years, and then moved back to Hyde Park, where they
lived the remainder of their lives building themselves a new home
there.</p>

<p>They were the parents of eleven children. Mother was a weaver
by trade and it was a great help to her throughout her life. She
was active in the Church, and with her husband they accomplished
many things. They did much to relieve the suffering in the
community, by practical nursing and caring for the sick, giving
to the poor and needy, as well as sharing their meager supplies
with the Indians. She lived to be 75 years of age. She passed to
the great beyond a faithful Latter-day Saint, and in full
fellowship of the Church. Much more could be said of her and what
she and her husband and family had to endure during the hardships
of the Pioneer days.</p>

<p>The children of Dorthea Marie and Lars L. Nielsen are: Rebecca
Nielsen Jorgensen, Alma, (who died in Denmark), Anne Nielsen
Miller, Baby Lauritz, (died while they were crossing the plains),
Mena (Minnie), Dorthea Nielsen, (burned to death at 5 years of
age), Lars L. Nielsen Jr., Tomena Kirstine Nielsen Balls, George
Christen Nielsen, John Peter Nielsen, and Andrew James Nielsen.</p>
