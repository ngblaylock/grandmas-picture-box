}{\plain \tab Father was born October 6, 1830 in a small place named Corren Agested Vensysel, 
Denmark.  His Father died when he was six years old.  This left his mother to care for three little 
children.  When he was three years old she married again and continued to live in the home 
given them by her parents. For some unknown reason the home was taken away from them later.  
When this happened, two more children had been added to the family, but the new husband left 
her and she was sent to the poor house. However, she did not have to remain there long.  She 
finally secured work but the wages were very meager.\par
}{\plain \tab Father commenced earning his own living at the age of nine years. His work, was caring 
for cows and sheep and his only compensation was board and clothes.  His clothes were made of 
homespun.  He had two shirts, two pair of trousers, two suits of underwear and two pair of 
stockings.  Trascoe (or wooden shoes) adorned his feet.  Child though he was he had been taught 
by his mother to darn his own stockings which made the two pairs last out the year.\par
}{\plain \tab Young people who hired out in those days always made promises to their employers to 
stay a certain length of time.  Usually this was for one year but it was not uncommon for them to 
remain at the same place ten and twelve years or longer.  If a change was made, a written 
recommendation from their old employer was necessary.  It was not difficult to secure 
employment if one had been a good servant.  And so father always possessed high 
recommendation and always had plenty of work.  At the age of 22 years he went to pass 
examination as a soldier. The officials only laughed at him because he was too small.  They told 
him to go home and grow.  This nearly broke his heart for it was a great honor to be a soldier.  It 
was some time between the ages of 22 and 30 that he heard the Gospel.  This message appealed 
to him and soon afterwards he joined the Church.  His special work in the Church was that of a 
local Elder and later Conference President.  It was soon after he joined the Church that Mother 
came into his life.  They were married October 14, 1860.  At this time he was working in a 
foundry in Aalborg and stayed there for a number of years\par
}{\plain \tab Four children came to bless their home before emigrating to America. Two; Rebecca and 
Alma were born in Aalborg.  Anna and Lauritz were born after moving to Huring.  Alma died 
when only 15 months old.\par
}{\plain \tab The Gospel meant everything to them. The spring of gathering to Zion came and so they 
decided to emigrate. The money for this was to be gotten from a loan from the Church with 10% 
interest. Ten young ladies wanted to go to Zion but notes had to be signed to pay their way so 
father signed with them.\par
}{\plain \tab With three small children Rebecca age 6, Anna age 3, and Laurite only three weeks; they 
were prepared to start on what proved to be a long, tiresome, venturesome journey.  Nine weeks 
they tossed about on the ocean.  Once the compass showed that the wind had carried them back 
farther than the distance they had traveled ahead.  When mother was questioned about the fear of 
the ocean she replied, "What good would it do to be afraid?  We are here.  All we can do is trust 
in God and go on."\par
}{\plain \tab When they reached Montreal they were placed in box cars (not as good as the ones cattle 
are carried in today), and hauled as far as Illinois.  From there they were to make the journey 
with mule and ox teams.  While crossing the plains the baby died (from lack of food) and was 
buried in a shallow grave.  Father took sick with cholera one week after burying his sister and 
her husband with the same disease. The company doctor placed him in the wagon and ordered 
him to take one pint of pain killer and cayenne pepper.  The captain assured him if he did not 
take it all he would die.  After he swallowed the last bit he said, "Now I can see you want me to 
die."  It took the disease from him however, and in a few hours he was able to walk again.\par
}{\plain \tab Upon arriving in Salt Lake City they were met by some of the Saints one of whom; Henry 
Naisbitt, offered to take Father's sister's children who were now left orphans.  Father and Mother 
wanted to take them on but Father's mother (Grandmother Nielsen) who was in the company, 
thought it best that they be left in Salt Lake City, thinking that their educational opportunities 
would be greater and they would be nearer to the leaders of the Church.\par
}{\plain \tab We remained in Salt Lake City two days and then proceeded on our journey.  Father's 
brother, Thomas had come to Logan a few years before and so it was decided to join them there.  
The first winter was spent in a dugout while father was busy getting logs from the canyon to 
build the one room which was to be their home for a number of years. Mother being a weaver by 
trade, was busy weaving to help finance the home.  Minnie and Lars and Thomas were born in 
this home.  It might be stated here that Mother's ability to earn and save seemed to be the 
greatest means of keeping the family.  Many times when tax time would come Father would 
come to Mother and say he had a chance to ride to Logan to pay the taxes but what could he do 
because he had no money to pay.  Mother always seemed to have the money saved ahead,  She"d 
tell him to get ready then hand him the hard earned money to meet obligations which she knew 
were coming.\par
}{\plain \tab Father had been corresponding with a cousin in California who desired him to come here 
for work. There were four of us children at this time. Lars was the baby. He went and assisted 
with the harvesting staying for about three months. He wanted Father to stay and move the 
family there and become foreman of the ranch. Although it seemed to mean more financially, 
Father had come to Zion for the Gospel's sake and preferred remaining in cache Valley with the 
Saints.\par
}{\plain \tab Father was still responsible for the notes he had signed with the young ladies who 
immigrated the same time as he did and so the $500.00 that was earned in California went to pay 
on that fee.  (Aunt Annie said that she did not mean that Father earned $500, in 3 months. He 
may have been there longer than that and perhaps someone can tell how long Father was gone.  
However he paid it.)  Labor was scarce and wages low so when the railroad came into the valley 
and the cut made through the mountains near Cache Junction, the saints were happy to receive 
the work,  It was doing this kind of labor which assisted Father to pay more on the immigration 
notes. While away from home this time it happened that Father dreamed the same dream three 
times in one night,  I don't recall the details of the dream, only that something seemed wrong at 
home,  He came home on Saturday evening and Sunday while at meeting, Minnie only 5 years of 
age played with the fire while mother ran to the neighbors to borrow a shovel to dig potatoes.  
She was gone only a few minutes but the child's apron caught on fire from the open grate of the 
old fashioned wood step stove.  Minnie ran out in the cold November winds for relief which only 
made it worse,  The first thought Mother had was "who in the world would want to burn the 
papoose?"  Minnie was already burned beyond recognition,  She only lived a few hours,  The 
only one with her was Lars who was trying to beat the flames with a stick.  The older children 
were away tending sheep,  This was a terrible tragedy in their lives. Doubley hard for it hadn't 
been long since Thomas, 21 months old died with scarlet fever.\par
}{\plain \tab The next spring we moved to Benson Ward.  The logs of the house were moved as well 
so we lived in a granary until it was rebuilt.  Mother's health was never so good after this, 
although she gave birth to a daughter and three sons, Tomenia, George, John, and Andrew, 
While we were living in Benson Ward, Father spent a part of his time in Montana working for\par
}{\plain the railroad.  Be was now able to pay more on the emigration notes.\par
}{\plain \tab A happy time came for all the Saints who owed immigration debts. All the debts were 
cancelled.  At last Father thought he did not have to pay any more for immigration but in the last 
few years of Father's life a letter came from the husband of one of the girls who had written 
asking for her immigration.  Father thought that when the man married the girl he would assume 
the obligation but his letter said," You know I still have your note."  So the last money Father 
earned went to pay this note.  He was always willing to serve and always willing to do the 
Master's bidding.\par
}{\plain \tab The Benson place was sold and they moved back to Hyde Park where they spent their last 
days.  Here on their five acre lot they built their home, planted the orchard, raised the feed for 
the cows and the chickens.  The home was beautiful and there was land enough to make a good 
honest living.\par
}{\plain \tab Father was always true to the Gospel in paying his tithing and fast offerings or anything 
that the ones who were placed over him asked.  He was always exhorting his children and 
grandchildren to be faithful and try and live their religion, and always try and be of service and 
keep all of the commandments of the Lord.  His testimony to his dying day was that the Church 
of Jesus Christ of Latter\_day Saints was the only true church upon the earth. He worked as a 
ward teacher first and gave them a desire to work in the various offices in the Church. never 
made a great show financially but still his last days were best.  He seemed to feel quite at ease 
when his children were all married.  He used to say he was glad to have us come to visit them.  
His health generally speaking was good.  Soon after his marriage he was afflicted with typhoid 
fever which left him with a partially weak stomach.  With this exception and a little rheumatism 
occasionally he seemed to enjoy the best of health.\par
