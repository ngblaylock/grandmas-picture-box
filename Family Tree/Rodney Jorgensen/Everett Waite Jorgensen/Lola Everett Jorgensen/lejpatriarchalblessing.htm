<p>Brother Lola Everett Jorgensen:</p>

<p>In the authority of the Holy Melchizedek Priesthood and in the
name of Jesus Christ I lay my hands upon your head to give unto
you a patriarchal blessing, and Father in heaven draw near unto
us upon this occasion and forgive us of our faults through life
as we have had many, and hold nothing between Thee and us to
debar the blessing for this Thy servant. </p>

<p>Dear brother, you are a chosen vessel in the eyes of God our
Father. You have accepted of the truth. You were faithful in your
pre-existent state and you have been permitted to come to earth
in this day and age and you have complied with the requirements
of the gospel. </p>

<p>Remember who you are, that you hold the priesthood and can
officiate in the same. When called to hold any calling go forth
in humility and you will perform it in honor, for God has
promised us every blessing which is for our good and benefit. </p>

<p>I bless you with every blessing God our Father has for his
faithful servants in the earth. I bless you with a renewed
portion of fatherhood and your posterity will listen to you and
call you blessed through your humility and integrity in this life.
Go forth and serve the Lord come what will for you are entitled
to every blessing God has for His faithful servants in the earth.
</p>

<p>God has blessed you with sons and daughters which He has
permitted to come forth in this day and age when the gospel has
been restored again and you are a partaker of those blessings. Be
honest and just in all your dealings and set an example to
mankind. </p>

<p>Know your mission in the earth and seek for wisdom. Be humble.
I bless you with a renewed portion of the spirit of the Lord and
the spirit of discernment and you will know in your life whether
or not mankind era God-fearing . Honor will come to you and
integrity and God will bless you. Your posterity will rejoice to
know you were a God-fearing man. </p>

<p>I seal you up against the power of the destroyer though trials
will come to you you will come out triumphant and you will see
the power of the evil one tremble before you. </p>

<p>I seal you up to come forth in the morning of the first
resurrection clothed with glory, immortality and eternal life,
and I do it as a patriarch in Israel and in the name of Jesus
Christ, Amen. </p>
