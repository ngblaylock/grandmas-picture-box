<p>On a warm summer day, 31 July 1881, a son was born to Isaac
and Rebecca Nielsen Jorgensen, in Logan, Cache County, Utah. This
was the first child born to this couple in a family of sixteen
children, eight boys and eight girls. He was blessed 1 October
1881 in Logan, Utah and given the name of Lola Everett Jorgensen
by Joseph Goddard.</p>

<p>As we don't know, we assume he lived a normal childhood like
all children do. Upon reaching the age of eight years of age,
Lola was baptized in the mill race at Central Mill, Logan, Cache
County, Utah by Charles Lundberg on 5 September 1889 and
confirmed the following day 6 September 1889 by Thomas Morgan.
Also when eight years of age a friend was swinging him by the
arms and hit his leg on a bench and broke his leg.</p>

<p>Lola started school in Logan, Utah and when he was ten years
old the family moved to Hyde Park, Utah in 1891, where he
continued his education. When he was old enough to attend BYU
College in Logan, he went there one year.</p>

<p>He herded sheep for his father above Hyde Park and one time
when he had to go to town to get supplies as he was returning he
saw tracks of where a bear had been following him when he went
down to get the supplies.</p>

<p>On March 1, 1897 he was ordained to the office of a Deacon by
J. W. D. Hurren, to the office of Teacher 5 May 1902 by Suel Lamb
Sr., and Elder 14 March 1904 by William Seamons. A High Priest 14
April 1935 by Adelbert E. Cranney.</p>

<p>At the age of nineteen he met a pretty brunette girl by the
name of Maria Elizabeth Waite, who was sixteen at the time. He
was attracted to her and courted her for three years and decided
this was the girl he wanted to share life and throughout eternity
so he took her to the LDS Temple in a buggy with one black horse
and one white horse in mud up to the hubs of the wheels and the
sun was shining beautifully.</p>

<p>They returned to Hyde Park where they set up housekeeping in a
small pink two story house. The next year they were blessed with
a baby daughter, this being the first child in a family of ten
children, six girls and four boys. This child was born on 10 June
1905 and given the name of Venna. After the baby was born Lola
was called to serve a Mission for the LDS Church in the
Scandinavian Mission. He left from home on 11 September 1905 to
journey to Salt Lake, his father going with him that far, leaving
a wife and a three month old child at home.</p>

<p>Upon arriving in Salt Lake they took a room at the Wilson
Hotel and after cleaning up went out to visit some of the
business houses and the Temple and Tabernacle. Some people wished
to see the inside of the Tabernacle so he was privileged to go
with them. It was explained how the Tabernacle was built and it
made quite an impression on him to think of a building being
built like that in those days with so few tools and materials to
work with and building an organ, too. This seemed quite wonderful
to him. That evening he attended a musical in the Tabernacle to
hear the organ.</p>

<p>The following day, 12 September 1905 Lola bought his ticket
for his trip to Boston and at 2 o'clock was set apart for his
mission. Then on 13 September left by train going through Ogden
to Omaha, and from Omaha he crossed over the Missouri and
Mississippi Rivers and on to Chicago. From Chicago to Boston with
a stop at Buffalo where he saw the Niagra Falls, crossed over and
saw the Falls from the Canadian side also, then proceeded to
Boston.</p>

<p>On 21 September he set sail aboard ship bound for Liverpool,
England. While en route a man died and was buried at sea. The
ship arrived in England on 29 September at 11 o'clock where they
embarked and after having dinner went to the Mission Headquarters
for instruction and to be assigned to his field of labor. On 2
October Lola left Liverpool to journey across England to the
North Sea and boarded the ship Batania sailing to Isberg, and was
sick until landing on 4 October 1905. He stayed there until next
morning and took a train to Copenhagen Conference. He labored in
this mission until his health failed then was released to return
home, leaving Denmark on 19 October 1906 by train to Liverpool,
England where he boarded a ship to sail back to the United States.
There were 111 Immigrants in the company on board the ship.</p>

<p>After eight days on the Ocean they first sighted land on 2
November 1906 and landed at Quebec, Canada on 3 November where
they were inspected by an Immigration Committee and then they
sailed till 2 o'clock on 4 November and landed, they then were
transported on to the Grand Trunk Depot where they had to spend
the night aboard the train and on November 6 crossed over into
the United States. He then returned back to Utah through Chicago
arriving in Salt Lake City on 9 November 1906 and then on to Hyde
Park where he was reunited with his wife and baby Daughter.</p>

<p>They had another daughter born on 18 November 1907 naming her
Berdice, another daughter was born the following year named
Carlyn. After this daughter was born moved up the hill
overlooking Hyde Park to see if it would improve Lola's health,
where he took up farming on a farm bought from his father Isaac
Jorgensen. This farm was mostly dry farm with a few acres under
irrigation.</p>

<p>Two more daughters joined the family, Lyda born 16 August 1910,
and Arda born 20 January 1913, they were followed by three boys,
Everett Waite, born 5 March l914, Levi Harold born 9 February
1916, and Cleon Alverdo born 14 November 1917. In 1918-19 there
was a flu epidemic and the family all contacted it. Maria
Elizabeth being pregnant at the time was very ill with a high
fever and they didn't know if she would recover or not, but she
recovered and all the children and Lola recovered too. Lola went
out and helped other people until he contacted the flu himself.</p>

<p>After the flu they had two more children, Norma born 21 June
1919, and Orlin Glenn born 21 December and lived until 27 January
1921 when he passed away from bronchial pneumonia.</p>

<p>Some time around 16 August 1925 Lola broke his leg again a few
inches above the previous break. He hauled milk with team and
wagon for a number of years, did blacksmith work for many people,
went to the canyon in the summers to cut maple wood to bring home
for firewood for winter. He was sexton of the Hyde Park Cemetery
for several years and often buried people for nothing when he
thought they couldn't afford to pay for it.</p>

<p>In the spring he would help drive cattle up the canyon to
graze for the summer and help bring them home in the fall, his
cattle among them. Lola was a Scouter for most of his life and he
enjoyed taking the boys on trips to White Pine and Tony Grove
Lakes for a week at a time riding horses with supplies on pack
horses each year. He felt bad because he could not achieve the
rank of Eagle he desired but was not able to because be was not
allowed to learn to swim as a young boy. He enjoyed doing Temple
work and genealogy which he did quite a sum of. He was a
genealogist of the Jorgensen family organization for a number of
years.</p>

<p>For several years in the fall he went to Lenrose, Idaho to dig
beets for Bill Heuser, living in a tent while there. One year he
took his wife with him. Lola and wife took care of Brother J. W.
Hurren and his wife, living with them and caring for them. They
also lived up Logan Canyon for four or five years herding cattle
in the summers, around 1951. He also worked in the mill for quite
a number of years.</p>

<p>Lola was a hard working man, working from daylight until dark
each clay. He believed in giving an honest days work whether for
someone else or himself and he never believed in working on
Sunday. Lola was a very religious man and believed in keeping the
Sabbath day as we are taught to do. He did much compassionate
service. He and his wife believed in being honest and taught
their children to do the same and to respect other people as well
as their parents and each other.</p>

<p>When he could no longer farm he and his wife Elizabeth (Lizzie)
moved down into Hyde Park town in 1954, where they could be
closer to the Church and they bought a little home. When he was
able he thinned beets for the ward farm.</p>

<p>His family loved and respected him and would honor him on his
birthdays each year with a family get together either up Logan
Canyon or at his residence. After retiring his wife quilted
quilts for people and he would help her put the quilts on the
frame and help where he could.</p>

<p>Lola passed away on 12 February 1963 at the age of 82. The
boys he taught in Scouts honored him by flying the flag at half
mast at his passing because they loved and respected him. There
was a large number of people who attended his funeral to pay
their respects to him. He was buried in the Hyde Park Cemetery.</p>

<p>His posterity at this writing number 10 children, 37 children,
75 great grandchildren and 4 great great grandchildren.</p>

<p>The following two poems were sent to Lola on Father's day by
his daughter Lyda J. Baur (1949)</p>

<p align="center">&quot;BEING DAD&quot;</p>

<p align="center">There are fathers who are serving </p>

<p align="center">In the way they think the best; </p>

<p align="center">There are those who are unswerving </p>

<p align="center">From a parent's interest. </p>

<p align="center">But the father who is taking </p>

<p align="center">All the pleasure to be had </p>

<p align="center">Is the fellow who is making </p>

<p align="center">A success of being &quot;Dad,&quot;</p>

<p align="center">Being &quot;Dad&quot; is not just feeding </p>

<p align="center">Little mouths that hungry are; </p>

<p align="center">Buying clothes they may be needing, </p>

<p align="center">Isn't being &quot;Dad,&quot; by far; </p>

<p align="center">Being &quot;Dad&quot; is but the artful</p>

<p align="center">Way of generating joy. </p>

<p align="center">And elation by the heartful </p>

<p align="center">In your little girl or boy. </p>

<p align="center">Make a kite for little Johnnie, </p>

<p align="center">Mend the doll for little Sue; </p>

<p align="center">Spin the top with little Ronnie &#150; </p>

<p align="center">These are proper things to do.</p>

<p align="center">Be a pal as well as parent;</p>

<p align="center">Forego affection that endures, </p>

<p align="center">And the flow of joy inherent,</p>

<p align="center">With its blessings, shall be yours.</p>

<p align="center">Make their sorrow all your sorrow, </p>

<p align="center">Make their happiness your joy; </p>

<p align="center">From the years of childhood borrow &#150; </p>

<p align="center">You were once a little boy.</p>

<p align="center">Live again your childhood measure </p>

<p align="center">Through your children, lass and lad </p>

<p align="center">And you'll marvel at the pleasure </p>

<p align="center">In the game of being &quot;Dad.&quot;</p>

<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="center">MY DAD</p>

<p align="center">He was six-feet-one in his stocking feet </p>

<p align="center">With a smile like the sunset's glow </p>

<p align="center">A man whom men were glad to meet </p>

<p align="center">And boys were proud to know.</p>

<p align="center">A man with a spirit that soared like a bird </p>

<p align="center">With a handclasp strong but kind; </p>

<p align="center">Whose sacred bond was his given word; </p>

<p align="center">Who praised but never maligned.</p>

<p align="center">A man whose soul acknowledged the right </p>

<p align="center">With conviction that could not be retreat; </p>

<p align="center">Whose heart or sword were bared to fight. </p>

<p align="center">When others acknowledged defeat.</p>

<p align="center">Who is this man whose songs I sing, </p>

<p align="center">Who is this Sir Galahad </p>

<p align="center">Within my heart enthroned a king? </p>

<p align="center">This wonderful man &#150; MY DAD.</p>
