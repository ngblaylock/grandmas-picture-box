}{\plain \tab Lola E. Jorgensen, we place our hands upon your head and set you apart for a mission to 
Scandinavia, whereunto you have been called by the prophet of god, and we seal upon you the 
spirit of this calling and say unto you, inasmuch as your heart's desire is to serve the: Lord and 
keep his commandments and live pure and holy, the spirit of this office and calling shall rest 
upon you and you shall be able to preach the gospel of life and salvation to those whom you will 
come in contact. The Lord will bless you and give you the language to convey your ideas and he 
will raise up friends unto you who will help you and feed you and give you a place of shelter and 
receive you in their houses. You shall be blessed and strengthened by day and by night, and the 
Lord will reveal unto you things that will comfort you, and you shall feel that the Lord is with 
you and help you and strengthen you, and you shall be able to overcome the weaknesses of your 
nature, and you shall have strength in your body and marrow in your bones. You shall be able to 
perform this mission to your own satisfaction, for the Lord will help you in every respect if you 
will keep yourself near unto Him. Subject yourself to the authorities of the mission and be kind 
to your traveling companions, and you shall always be on the safe side of the question, and when 
the Lord blesses you with talent, always give the honor and glory to Him. Go forth and spare not; 
lift up your voice and proclaim the gospel and warn the inhabitants of the nation where you shall 
labor, that they may understand that the kingdom of the Son of God is near at hand. Testify that 
Joseph Smith was a prophet of the living God in these last days and that this is the gospel of life 
and salvation that you are bearing to them. We say unto you, dear brother, inasmuch as you will 
keep yourself pure, the Lord will bless you and give you many friends and you shall rejoice and 
feel that these are the best days of your life. We say unto you, dear brother, that you shall go in 
peace and return in safety and be blessed in every respect. \par
}{\plain \tab We seal upon you every blessing that your heart can desire in righteousness and reseal 
upon you all your former blessings and ordinations, and we say unto you, receive this call and go 
forth and be a servant of the living God in truth and deed. These blessings, with all necessary 
blessings to qualify you for this mission, we seal upon you in the name of Jesus, even so, amen.\par
