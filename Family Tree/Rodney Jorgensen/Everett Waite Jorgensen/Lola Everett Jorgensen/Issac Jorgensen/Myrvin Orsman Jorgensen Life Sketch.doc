}{\plain \tab I was born in Hyde Park, Utah, the 27th of October 1894, the twelfth of sixteen children. \par
}{\plain \tab We lived in a frame house on a big corner lot in the town section off Hyde Park. My 
father also had a farm and range land on the foot hills near our, home. My earliest memories are 
of how I used to help my mother and brothers and sisters care for the vegetable garden and the 
beautiful flowers my mother always strived to have surrounding our home. I also had to help 
milk the cows and walking, drive them to the pasture and go after them in the evening. I began 
school at the age of eight, and went as far as the fifth grade. On the 12th day of March in 1907 I 
left school to go to the winter range to care for my fathers sheep, at Wendover, Utah. My older 
brother Leeman and I were to bring the sheep to the lambing grounds in Johnson\'92s Canyon, in 
Box Elder County, Utah. I was thirteen years of age at this time, and my work was to haul water 
from the springs along the way in two ten gallon wooden kegs for culinary purposes around 
camp Sometimes we would melt snow for the purpose to save going so far to get water. My 
other chores included cooking, going for supp1ies and moving the camp site.\par
}{\plain \tab It was about ten weeks from the time we started for the winter range to move the sheep 
till they were moved.-------, sheared, and back on summer range again. I remembered sugar beets 
were ready to be thinned just as we arrived back on the farm in Hyde Park, about the first part of 
June. The sugar beet industry was rather new at this time in 1907. It was thought at that time the 
sugar beets should be planted late enough to avoid the spring frost. After helping on the farm 
during the summer, I went back to the winter range the 2}{\plain \super nd}{\plain  of October. This time it was the Deep 
Creek Range in Nevada; and I was with the sheep all that winter and in the spring of 1908, we 
left there and went up the trail to the Delno Range, (in Nevada), to lamb. We also erected a 
shearing corral at Annerville Springs, close by and after the sheep were sheared we put them on 
summer range in care of a herdsman and returned to the ranch to irrigate and do general farm 
work. \par
}{\plain \tab This time the ranch I worked on was the Twelve Mile Ranch in Nevada. It was located 
twelve miles north and west of Tacoma, Nevada. My folks had moved from Hyde Park, Utah to 
this big stock ranch, known as the Vineyard Land and Livestock Company. My Father had 
bought part interest in the Company. This company had holdings in a one hundred square mile 
radius of land. There were thousands of water springs all over the hundred  miles square of land 
and where the water springs were the Company owned land thus giving them control over the 
hundred square miles of range land. They put us a lot of hay for the cattle; intact we began 
haying on the fifth of July and from then on we cut and put up hay, rain or shine ,till the 
fourteenth of October. I did a lot of riding in the fall, gathering cattle off the open range and 
feeding them thru the winter. While on this farm in Nevada it was my job to help the driver 
change horses on the stage coach night and morning for four trips a week. This stage coach 
carried mail one hundred and ten miles between Sanyucina Ranch, Nevada to Tacoma, Nevada. 
The horses were wild to handle and I also had to feed and curry and care for the horses used on 
the trips. We were on this place till the spring of 1910. At this time my folks decided to buy a 
cattle ranch at Etna, Utah and we moved there. Again I worked feeding cattle, putting up hay and 
riding the range on thru the year of 1911. I now started to school again in Etna, Utah; but found I 
had to quit again in three months because of farm duties and about this time I was sent to work 
on the West Cache Orchard Company farm in Amalga, Cache, Utah of which my father was 
manager and I also worked in my fathers flour mill, located in Smithfield, Utah. \tab In the year of 
1915 on September the 8}{\plain \super th}{\plain , in Logan, Cache County, Utah, I married Martha Ann Buck. One 
daughter, Bernice, and two sons, Kenneth and Elaine were born in Smithfield, Utah. During this 
time I did some farming of my own on rented land. I also built a house in Smithfield, but left and 
moved to Avon, Utah on a farm. It was here Ila Beth was born. Later I moved to Moreland, 
Idaho and learned to make cheese for the Kraft Cheese Company; making cheese; in the Idaho 
factories located Moreland, Darlington, Malta, Pocatello, Grace Blackfoot, and Aberdeen. It was 
in Aberdeen that Laura was born and the 1929 depression was still raging. Now I decided to take 
the boys out on a farm to live. We moved onto a rented farm in Burley, Idaho. We lived there 
and farmed for seventeen years. We then moved to Renton, Washington, where I was employed 
by the Boeing Aircraft Company, as a painter. I remained in their employ for eight years, at 
which time I was retired at the age of sixty five years. In June of 1960 while on vacation I 
suffered a Stroke which affected my left side. I worked after my recovery from this a custodian 
for three Renton ward, one of which was mine, for several years. In February of 1971 because of 
my health, I moved back to Pocatello, Idaho, to be near my son Elaine, who is a physician, so he 
could help take care of me. I lived here until August 3, 1976 , when I moved to Aberdeen into a 
Senior citizen housing apartment which was ground level and I could no longer manage the steps 
in the home in which we resided in Pocatello. This was because of having suffered a broken hip \par
}{\plain \tab [Added by Bernice]\par
}{\plain \tab Uncle Leeman told me of an accident my father had as a child. He was real small and his 
mother had just lost recently lost two babies prayed she be spared this child who had fallen from 
the loft of the barn landing on his head. He was spared to her for which I am very grateful. \par
}{\plain \tab As a child I remember his patience with animals , which he could get to do most anything 
he tried to get them to. He and Uncle Quinn were very close and I remember them working 
together quite a bit. Uncle Quinn lived with us and he and Dad built many toys for us as kids. He 
was a hard worker all his life, sometimes working the clock around with the exception of 
an\_hour or two of sleep. He was an expert cheesemaker and even after he left the factory the 
Kraft Cheese Company tried to get him to come back to work for them several times, especially 
during the war years. He believed in giving a good days work for his pay and during his employ 
at Boeing his work evaluation sheets were very praiseworthy of his work. \par
}{\plain \tab Though he did not receive much schooling he never lost his desire to learn more. He was 
confined to a chair most of the last years of his life; but never lost that ability to learn. His mind 
was as sharp as it ever was right to the end. He remembered things that put me to shame, for I 
could not remember many of he things he did. He loved his family, though it was hard for him to 
put it in words. We still knew by his actions and things he did that he loved us. He was very 
proud off his grandchildren and his great grandchildren. \par
}{\plain \tab He passed away at Pocatello, Idaho, August 29, 1977 and was buried September 1, 1977 
beside his infant son, Victor in the family plot at Smithfield, Utah.}}
