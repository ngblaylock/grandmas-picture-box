}{\plain \tab In Denmark in the early eighteen hundreds, a jovial man, butcher by trade, by the name 
of Hans Jorgensen, lived with his wife, Maren Kistina Jorgensen, in fairly prosperous 
circumstances.  He was at the time this story begins, about fifty\_six years old, fond of his teddy 
jug and his pipe and quite content with his mode of living.\par
}{\plain \tab One day Hans Jorgensen looked up from his butcher's block to see his son standing in the 
doorway.  The boy has come to talk about the New Gospel he had heard at a Mormon 
Missionary meeting. Shortly after that day, Hans' friends were surprised to see him minus his 
pipe, and were quite astounded upon visiting his house not to be offered liquor by way of 
refreshment.\par
}{\plain \tab Thereafter he often said of the Gospel: "If it is worth anything, it is worth everything", 
and he subsequently gave up everything: his home and business, his friends and country, and 
with his wife was baptized in 1851, sailing the following year for America aboard a small vessel.\par
}{\plain \tab Before he reached the new land, Hans Jorgensen had also to give up his wife in the new 
cause, for the hardships of the rough sea journey caused her death near New Orleans, and she 
was buried on an island.  The vessel sailed on up the Mississippi River to St. Louis, Missouri 
arriving there April 1, 1853. Here the company prepared themselves for the long perilous trek 
across the plains to Utah. Their leader was John Forsgren.\par
}{\plain \tab The faith of the group was put to a hard test when their money which they turned over to 
Forsgren to be exchanged for American coins was never returned to them.  H.P. Benson, a man 
in whom the Scnadinavian people had much confidence, consoled them by prophesying that they 
would all be better off than Forsgren. This proved true for this dishonest man died an apostate 
pauper.\par
}{\plain \tab As Hans Jorgensen walked beside his ox team toward Utah, the land of the Saints, all his 
earthly goods in a canvas\_topped wagon, he sometimes found himself longing for a companion 
to make gentler his harsh existence. He was not yet aware of a sweet\_faced girl in the company, 
one of a group which walked ahead of the wagons to gather the wood for fires when camp was 
pitched.\par
}{\plain \tab Dorthea Christensen had heard and embraced the Gospel in her father's home in Odense, 
Veborrie, Denmark.  Christen Andersen, a carpenter was an indulgent father, and would often 
enjoy a romp with little Dorthea and her brothers and sisters.  However, they seldom took 
advantage of him, for when they quarreled or otherwise acted rude he would speak to them at 
once, and if they did not heed, he would throw his red cap at them, which was a danger signal all 
understood.\par
}{\plain \tab While still a young girl, Dorthea was given the task of tending her father's sheep and 
geese.  While waiting for the animals to graze their fill and be staked out in another place, the 
girl learned to embroider on net cloth.  This kind of work she loved above all things. Her 
children remember the accounts of the pretty flowers she sewed while the sheep-bells tinkled 
around her, and how once upon seeing such a piece of net embroidery, tears came to her faded 
eyes remembering her childhood.\par
}{\plain \tab Dorthea's mother, Anna Maria Andersen, was left a widow while the children were still 
small.  Consequently they had a poor chance for education but were obliged to go out to work as 
soon as they were able.  Dorthea when she was old enough, took her sister's place in the 
household of Niels Hansen, a well\_to\_do farmer.  There she had to milk the cows, work in the 
fields, spin and card wool, and help with the housework. She worked there for eight years. When 
she left her wages consisted of $10.00 in cash, two pairs of wooden shoes, five pounds of wool 
with which to make clothes and stockings, and two suits of underwear which she herself made of 
homespun flax.\par
}{\plain \tab The willing, cheerful girl was liked by all the Hansen family, and one of the rich farmer's 
tall sons liked her so well that he asked her to marry him.  Hans Christian Hansen and Dorthea 
Christensen became sweethearts and were to be married when something unexpected happened. 
Another "Hans" of whom she had not heard was to claim her hand.\par
}{\plain \tab The girl went one night to a meeting of the Latter\_Day Saints and came away with a great 
deal to think about.  When she explained to her lover the strange and beautiful feeling the words 
of the missionaries awakened in her, she was troubled to find him displeased and angry. A short 
time later she chose the Mormon Gospel instead of the ring her recalcitrant lover wished to give 
her, and she was baptized on November 5,  1852.   The promise of rich Mr. Hansen to give them 
all his lands and cattle if Dorthea would marry his son, could not tempt her, and she sailed with 
her mother and two sisters on December 10, 182 for America.\par
}{\plain \tab For many weeks the man Hans Jorgensen and the girl Dorthea traveled in the same 
company on the way to Utah without knowing that fate planned to mate them.  At last on July 4, 
1853 by a campfire at Council Bluffs, these two were united before God.  Thereafter they 
walked hand in hand beside the oxen, and when night fell and camp was pitched, they shared the 
same wagon.  They talked eagerly of reaching the valley of the mountains where they could help 
build the temple in which they could pledge eternal vows.\par
}{\plain \tab Reaching Salt Lake City, October 1, 1853, after great hardships on the plains, Hans 
Jorgensen and his young wife made a dugout in which to begin a home.  They lived here (in 
what later became the Salt Lake Fifth Ward) for several years.  Hans Jorgensen soon went to 
work with his neighbors to begin digging the first foundation of the Salt Lake Temple.  His wife 
did washings and housework for the more prosperous inhabitants. Soon she had two little sons to 
demand her care and the little family survived the grasshopper invasion and consequent famines, 
managing to survive on sego roots and when extraordinarily blessed, on coarse bread.\par
}{\plain \tab At one time brave little Mrs. Jorgensen was asked to do a washing for the Heber C. 
Kimball family.  "The washing" turned out to be a wagon full of clothes which took her three 
days to scrub clean. When she had finished, two round silver dollars were  laid in her palm.  The 
money must have looked like a great fortune to her after the desperate circumstances she had 
been through, for she went door to door among her neighbors to show them the prize.  One of the 
neighbors who was an invalid became so jealous of lucky Mrs. Jorgensen, that she had a relapse 
and had to take to her bed.\par
}{\plain \tab In the fall when the harvests were gathered, the Saints who had been unlucky with their 
crops were allowed to glean enough wheat for bread from the full fields.  Young mother 
Jorgensen took her little son just beginning to walk, into the fields with her.  In the evening when 
the sacks were full and little Jacob was tired, she found it a problem to manage her burdens, for 
the little boy would be unable to walk farther and would sit down in the stubble and cry for his 
mother to carry him.\par
}{\plain \tab The Jorgensen family lived in Salt Lake City for about two and a half years, then moved 
to Brigham City where they made their home for nine years.\par
}{\plain \tab Soon after settling in Brigham, Mrs. Jorgensen began spinning the thread that was to be 
woven into temple clothes for herself and her husband. On the day that they planned to make the 
trip to the temple in Salt Lake, she had laid out their white costumes on the kitchen table to pack 
them.  Noticing some little article missing, she decided to borrow it from a neighbor.  Being 
early in the morning, the children were all asleep.  A candle still burned near a window where 
dawn was just showing.  From the neighbor's house some distance away, the mother some 
minutes later heard a shriek of "Fire!".  She ran out in the street to see their straw\_roofed 
home\_in flames.  By working quickly, she was able to get the children out unhurt, but the trip to 
the temple had to be postponed until a later date.\par
}{\plain \tab Five years after the settlement of Logan, the family moved here on April 18, 1865.  This 
became their permanent home, where the remainder of the lives of the mother and father were 
spent.\par
}{\plain \tab Mr. Jorgensen and his older sons helped to make the Upper Canal, known as the "Logan 
and Richmond Canal".  All of the excavating for the canal had to be done by the tedious 
pick\_and\_shovel method.  They also helped build the first railway from Ogden to Cache Valley.  
On the day that the first "Puffing Billie" as the train engine was called, pulled into Cache 
County, there was much celebrating among the Saints who had given brawn and muscle to make 
such a triumph possible.\par
}{\plain \tab Having at last received the blessing of the Lord on their crops and herds, the Jorgensens 
now prospered. The father began thinking of presenting his five strapping sons: Jacob, Isaac, 
Abraham, Joseph, and Moses, with lands of their own to till.  Gathering two loads of rough 
lumber with which to build a shanty, the father and his sons set out across David Reese's Ferry to 
find virgin land.  A little north and east of the David Reese ranch, they unhitched sagebrush with 
their teams and set up camp.  Hans Jorgensen knelt down in the sagebrush and asked God to 
bless the land for the good of his family and their children after them.  The acres now rest the 
homes of many of his grandchildren, who are this day prospered by the Lord.\par
}{\plain \tab Numerous bears lived in the dry brush along the river banks.  One evening Jacob stayed 
late at his fishing.  It was after dark when he went to bring the cows out of the brush for milking, 
eating his supper of mush and milk on the way.  His dog sent into the dense undergrowth soon 
began baying the cows out one by one.  But with the last cow came a mother bear and her four 
cubs!  They padded along behind the herd, hurrying or slowing down as the boy did their greedy 
eyes fixed upon him. When Jacob reached home, the she\_bear had come up close behind him.  
Sseing the strange procession approaching the house, Mother Jorgensen called the other boys to 
help gather fuel for a bonfire, which eventually frightened the bears into the woods, although 
they were stalking the house all night.\par
}{\plain \tab Bears were also often a grave menace to sheep and cattle in that vicinity.  One morning 
Mother Jorgensen was alarmed to find that the sheep were in a panic and that some of them were 
missing from the corral. None of the boys were home and she was alone with the younger 
children. That night she took the eldest girl and made their beds on top of a low shed in the yard 
to watch for the sheep thief.  About midnight they were awakened by the sound of sheep milling 
against the willow fence.  They could distinguish a large black beast resting its forepaws upon 
the fence.  It was too dark to determine what it was.  Although they had a gun they decided 
against firing since if the intruder were a bear, it would surely attack them if wounded.  The two 
stood up on the roof and clapped their hands and shouted which caused the bear to go off 
leisLirely.  They kept up the applause throughout the night each time the bear returned until he 
finally loped across the river near morning.  The next day a full grown grizzly bear was shot near 
Smithfield, evidently the would\_be "kid" napper.\par
}{\plain \tab The Jorgensen homestead in Logan was a typical pioneer abode.  A three room log house 
stood toward the front of a large cleared space. Along the north side of the yard were grouped 
several low buildings, straw\_covered, where pigs, sheep, cows and horses were comfortably 
housed.  Across each end of the yard was a long shed for the loose cattle. Potato and vegetable 
pits were situated near the house.  The north room of the log cabin was used as a granary, the 
middle room was the boys' bedroom and part of the year as a storeroom for flour, apples, dried 
fruits and dried herbs, and jeans for the boys' suits.  The south room of the cabin served as 
kitchen, living room and bedrooms.  First provided with an open fireplace where cooking and 
roasting was done as well as "shin\_toasting" in cold weather, this kitchen later boasted a Franklin 
stove.  A table, three of four rude chairs, a trunk and a bed as well as a trundle bed in which 
most of the children had their turn, were the main articles of furniture.  In the cellar built against 
the east side of the house, shelves lining the walls were always laden with cheeses, the top 
shelves suspended by wires from the ceiling so mice could not get at them.  The lower shelves 
were used for milk; great quantities of it unless the cows were dry, which they were three of four 
months out of each year.  Barrels of meat and sausages; some of which was cured and buried in 
the wheat for summer, were kept here.  The shelves next to the floor were used for preserved 
fruits and jams and for kegs of homemade molasses.  On the other shelves stood large pans of 
lard turned upside down, a bucket of tallow for greasing the boys' high boots and for wagon 
dope.  Bunches of tallow candles always dangled from the roof. The house was surrounded with 
sunny marigolds; cool morning glories kissed the window panes, and four o'clocks, amber and 
other flowers bordered each side of the path.\par
}{\plain \tab Here Hans Jorgensen and his wife kept their family of eight children well and hearty by 
the labor of their hands and their faith in the goodness of God and the divinity of the Gospel.\par
}{\plain \tab As the children grew older, the father and older brothers stayed in town to take care of 
the farm and work.  The boys often freighted to Montana and would bring home tokens of their 
travels to their eager sisters.  Later the boys tried their luck at dry-farming on the ranch, to which 
very little water was available.  Meeting with scant success they tried to get water to their land 
by means of an engine pump but found it difficult to bring the water over the hill.  The problem 
was solved when a group of farmers; the Jorgensen boys among them; dug a canal from Bear 
River which thereafter was used to irrigate their\_lands.\par
}{\plain \tab So the family prospered, new land was cleared and settled, the cattle multiplied.  Mother 
Jorgensen schooled her little ones with but text book to help her; the family Bible brought from 
Denmark.  When they were older they attended Sunday School and learned to count precious 
their birthright under the covenant.\par
}{\plain \tab On March 19, 1878, five sons and three daughters stood with their mother around the bed 
of Hans Jorgensen; now 82 years old.  With trembling hands he blessed each one and closed his 
eyes in death.  A neighbor spoke for all who knew him when he placed upon his casket a wreath 
with a verse in the center written by Eliza R. Snow: "'Tis good to die as he has died, He smiled 
amid death's conquering gloom, while angels waited by his side, to bear a kindred spirit home."\par
}{\plain \tab Mother Jorgensen lived to see all her children married, and when she passed away on 
October 3, 1902, she left her children: Jacob, Isaac, Abraham, Anna Marie, Mary Kistina, 
Hansine Rebecca, Joseph Christian and Moses Peter, and twenty\_five grandchildren.\par
}{\plain \tab From the lives of this faithful man and his wife, all of their numerious descendents can 
derive inspiration and example.. They have joined hands in another world for a journey across 
the plains of eternity.\par
