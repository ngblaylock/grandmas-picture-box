}{\plain \tab We should be proud of their blood running through our veins, For a stalwart heritage who 
made possible, us grasping life\'92s reins. Eight children blessed this couple with standards high, A 
family that has helped bring happiness to many, we can\'92t deny. Names from the Bible were 
chosen to be one of the children\'92s crowns, And they proudly did their names justice, whether 
they wore pants or gowns \par
}{\plain \tab Don\'92t we feel proud of JACOB who proved to be a pioneer in every way? And of his 
helpmate Melvina, ever by his side day by day, Encouraging him and both being brave to help 
break traditions that \'93this isn\'92t possible\'94, you\'92ll lose your shirt Jake. For it took men and women 
like this to prove \'93it can be done\'94, People who weren\'92t afraid of hard work, sweat and the feel of 
discouragement's gun. How the posterity of these two Jorgensen\'92s must fill with pride, When 
they hear stories how Jake and Melvina took life in their stride. \par
}{\plain \tab ISAAC, must have made his parents smile as his talent unfolded to them, A worker in the 
rich soil that will ever produce a new gem. One of God\'92s faithful women was also a great gift to 
this man, Together they worked and schemed to help develop God\'92s great plan. Their children 
were so welcome and truth prevailed at every turn, They worked as a unit in those long ago days 
and did yearn To give their posterity a candle to work by all, their lives through, Whether they be 
doctors, lawyers, farmers or whatever they chose to do. For they realized in life its worth, and the 
everlasting beauty, And as Mom and Dad or Aunt Rebecca and Uncle Isaac they did their duty. 
So we salute this family head who stands in line for a vote of thanks, And who, wherever they 
are in righteousness, hold high ranks. \par
}{\plain \tab ABRAHAM also did his name proud, although not in worldly fame, But in worthwhile, 
useful achievement just the same. Aunt Minnie thought him an awfully good person to know,\par
}{\plain As their relationship grew into years you could feel this same glow. A glow that their children, 
and children\'92s children will ever speak of with respect,\par
}{\plain \tab For they are so proud of their pioneer heritage who ever stood erect, On every principle 
that helps to make family bonds tied with a knot, Ties, that even with all the money and fame 
possible, cannot be bought. How thankful they must feel to be born of such goodly stock, To 
know their \'93houses were not built of sand but of solid rock.\'94 \par
}{\plain \tab JOSEPH came along and wasn\'92t missing any of his brothers traits, He also did his part in 
letting God guide him through good gates. The Jorgensen\'92s name carried down through Uncle 
Joe and Aunt Janies family tree Can boast of farmers and business men who the world could 
desire to I\'92ll bet this posterity have many wonderful tales to tell, Of a big yellow brick house 
where children in fun did yell. Also, how they were trained to appreciate mother nature\'92s 
pleasures  As they plowed, harrowed, irrigated and hoed their parents treasures So the memory 
of Joe and Jennie to this fine family is revered, They must feel humble thanks today, and often, 
for how they were reared. \par
}{\plain \tab MOSES was a name Hans and Dorthea also did choose, But who would ever deny Uncle 
Moses not filling the shoes. He and Aunt Rue had their heartaches and joys with the rest, But 
could somehow interpret it as being for the best. Nanna knew a home with them that must fill 
her with love, Recognizing they were chosen spirits coming from a high above. Patient, kind and 
with a sense of humor too. Couldn\'92t we all gain from their lives an important life's clue The 
feminine side of the family we will now interview.\par
}{\plain \tab MARIA, a strong personality of which today there are few.\tab Never too tired or busy to be 
an angel of mercy to the sick, There wasn\'92t a problem or disaster that with her outlook on life; 
couldn\'92t lick She homesteaded for two husbands and children she held dear, Teaching them if 
they lived righteously they had nothing to fear. there was always roan at her house for one more 
to come and abide, Many have profited by wise advice given while working or visiting by her 
side. Her posterity take their places proudly in the world today, Excelling in their chosen fields, 
whether farmers, or if they have a new road to lay. She knew the meaning of physical labor and 
even pain before she passed away, But to a reward saved just for her; for accomplishments in life 
lived day by day.\par
}{\plain \tab MARY. She chose a God\_fearing man to walk by her side ever steady, Anything put 
before then to work out together they were always ready. Whether it was for their children, who 
came in an even dozen, Or for the happiness of anyone or anything) be it an animal or cousin. 
their doors always bad Welcome written across the wood, People were meant to be happy here, 
at least they did all they could. Family projects, family dinners and family jokes were ever a 
circle round, In that Big Red house there was seldom a quiet sound. Aunt Mary could cook food 
to bring out the flavor divine, As well as cleverly teach truth and kindness to the utmost sublime. 
To be able to call her that precious word Grandma, friend, mother or aunt, to describe what that 
choice spirit stands for to her posterity, I can\'92t. How proud these two Monks would be to view 
the abilities of posterity they love so, Doctors, dairy men, business men, scholars, bishops, and 
so many who their church love and know. Would bring tears of thankfulness to their eyes as at 
each they would smile Immediately planning a farni1y dinner; after all they should be busy and 
doing something worthwhile.\par
}{\plain \tab REBECCA describes a very patient, kind and unselfish person when brought to our 
family test, She so helped to influence the privileged people who knew her the very best. Her 
talents were not hidden but developed and grew no end, Especially when those things she knew 
were right she stood to defend. She proved to be such a wise choice for Uncle Pete Frost to 
desire, And was the kind of mother and neighbor anyone would like to acquire. She taught good 
things every day of her life through,\tab  To her own flesh and blood, or peoples of every hue.\par
}{\plain She had a desire to help her fellow man in any fix, Using her many gifts and talents that some 
people called \'93some tricks.\'94 The Hans and Dorthea family wouldn\'92t have been complete without 
this accomplished lass, To her wonderful, devout family, the name, Rebecca in this whole 
Jorgensen family heads the class. \par
}{\plain \tab Oh! shouldn\'92t we feel grateful for relatives so strong and true, They hold a challenging 
example before me and you. God Bless them for the indelible memories they\'92ve left behind, 
Where\tab could we have chosen a better heritage of any kind? \par
