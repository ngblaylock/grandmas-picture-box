<p>Isaac lived in Brigham City, Utah until 1866 when his family
moved to Logan, Utah. He lived in Logan with his family until his
marriage. (See family history for this information)</p>

<p>During the latter part of August in 1879, Isaac and his
brother Jacob took a load of freight from Corrine, Utah to Butte,
Montana. Grandpa was to be married in February of the following
year. He and Uncle Jake were snowed in at Little Elkhorn Canyon.
They were not able to get back until the middle of May. It had
been thought for quite some time that Indians had killed them.</p>

<p>On July 8, 1880, Isaac was married to Rebecca Nielsen at the
Salt Lake Endowment House. At this time, he was working for
George Lindquist as a carpenter and cabinet maker. Being an
excellent craftsman, he made their first dresser and bed from
native cedar. This furniture is still in the family. The dresser
was given to Sybil Christensen at the time of Isaac's death. She
had received the bed a few years earlier. Sybil refinished the
bed when she received it. With help from Levi and Everett
Jorgensen, sons of Lola Jorgensen, the dresser was refinished.</p>

<p>Four or five years after he was married, Isaac was called to
labor as an ordinance worker in the Logan Temple. Prior to this
he had worked on the construction of the temple. It is said that
he built the stairway railing in the priesthood room, and he did
a considerable amount of the finish work in the first room of the
temple.</p>

<p>Although he held no formal degrees, he attended the B.Y.
College sometime during his early married life. The following
tribute was paid him by Clarence Hurren, a resident of Hyde Park,
and later principal of Smithfield Junior High School and North
Cache High School. It was told to Harl Noble in a classroom
situation. (The same thing had been told to Lola Jorgensen by Mr.
Hurren) Karl was asked: &quot;aren't you a grandson of Isaac
Jorgensen?&quot; Harl answered yes. &quot;I never saw a man who
could use his brain so well in mathematical calculations. I have
sold him grain, and it didn't make any difference whether it was
500 bushels or 5,000 pounds, he could have the price figured in
his head and the check made before I could do it with a pencil
and paper. It seemed to make no difference the rate of pay per
bushel or found!</p>

<p>He was also an outdoorsman of some note. When Uncle Leeman and
grandpa were taking sheep from Tony Grove to Montpelier for
shipping they were camped on the summit. They kept a fire going
to keep the lambs from wandering around as they hang toward the
light. They made a dash for the fire and then turned back.
Grandpa told Leeman that there was a bear among them. The bear
left without harming the lambs. The next day when they arrived at
Garden City some men had killed a grizzly bear that got into
their sheep. It was probably the same one.</p>

<p>At about the time he was doing temple work, he managed the
Equitable General Merchandise Store for a few years. In 1890, he
went to Baker City, Oregon, where he went into the lumber
business with Wm. Thomas and David Eccles. He stayed only one
summer. Uncle Glenn, the ninth child, was born while they were in
Baker City.</p>

<p>At this time he and his brother, Abraham, started the Coop
Lumber Yard in Logan. They obtained their lumber from Temple Mi11
in Logan Canyon.</p>

<p>He sold his share of the lumber business to Abraham and moved
his family to Hyde Park, Utah, in 1892 to provide more land and
space for his family. Rhoda Perkes, his sixth child, now lives in
this home (1964). At this time he was in the feed and seed
business and owned the Logan Seed and Elevator Company and a herd
of approximately 9,000 sheep. Vera and Grace, two of his
daughters, talked about the sheep inspector when they were
dipping the sheep. He sold the sheep and bought three flour mills:
The Farmer's Union at Smithfield, Utah; the Cache Valley Milling
Company at Richmond, Utah; and the Weston Milling Company at
Weston, Idaho. (Check Grandma Jorgensen's history for some of
this detail).</p>

<p>He maintained his homestead property in Amalga, Utah during
this time. This property was later organized into the Cache
Valley Orchard Company. At about this time, he owned a coal yard
and sold coal to Hyde Park residents.</p>

<p>In 1909 Isaac took his family to the Vineyard Land and Stock
Company at Tacoma, Nevada (Twelve Mile Ranch). They stayed about
a year and a half and then went to Etna, Utah to live on the
Fletcher Ranch. He changed the name to the Etna Land and Stock
Company.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1910, Retta, Grace, and Vera were returning
to the ranch from Logan where they had been attending school. The
girls gave a vivid description of the trip. They claim they
traveled all over &quot;Hell's creation&quot; to get there. They
took ten days to go about one hundred and forty miles. They said,
&quot;Dad never was in much of a hurry to get where he was going!&quot;</p>

<p>The family moved to Logan in 1911 but retained the Etna Ranch
for several years, probably selling it in December of 1917. At
this time he maintained three homes; one in Logan, one in Amalga,
and one in Smithfield. The children's time was spent in operating
these separate properties; Etna Land and Stock Company, Cache
Valley Orchard Company and the Farmers Union Flour Mill. The main
home was at 55 East 5th North, Logan, Utah.</p>

<p>In 1914, he acquired a general store in Grouse Creek, Utah.
Leeman and his wife Mary ran it for two years until he was called
on a mission, at which time Vera and her husband Elias ran it for
about two years. Orilla and her husband went back and operated it
as a store and a hotel for two years. Then Orilla and her husband
got sick and had to return to Logan. At this time Grandpa and
Grandma took it over and operated it until Orilla and Charlie
were able to operate it again for about four years. Grandpa then
took over the management and had it for about one and a half
years. In July 1922, he had an accident with an oil lamp and it
burned to the ground. It was a complete loss except for a small
amount of insurance on the stock.</p>

<p>He sold the Etna property for $45,000.00. This was deposited
in an Ogden Bank and later invested in various business ventures.
They proved to be of little value. When he died, he had expended
all of his funds.</p>

<p>He contributed toward the building of many church buildings,
including the Hyde Park chapel, the Richmond Tabernacle, the
Weston chapel, the Grouse Creek chapel, Smithfield 1st Ward, the
Logan 9th Ward, the Logan Tabernacle, and the Logan Temple. It
was discussed that Isaac was a very ardent worker in the church,
attending all of his meetings, paying his tithing, etc., until he
was released as an officiator at the temple. This seemed to cause
him to change his attitude, although he was always valiant in the
church, but did not attend church regularly. The girls never
remember having family prayers, although he taught his children
to attend to all of their church duties and activities. He was
never known by them to attend church regularly but always
contributed financially to the various organizations as he was
contacted for this purpose.</p>

<p>This material was put down while the following children
discussed his life: Lola, Jorgensen, Alvaretta Leora Jorgensen
Christensen, Rhoda Eva Jorgensen Perkes, Grace Viola Jorgensen
Hadfield, Vera LaVene Jorgensen Noble. Checked with Leeman
Jorgensen the next day. May 13, 1959 at Hyde Park, Utah Sybil
Christensen. Material re-written by Gary Jorgensen, son of
Darrell Jorgensen. Typed August 1964.</p>
