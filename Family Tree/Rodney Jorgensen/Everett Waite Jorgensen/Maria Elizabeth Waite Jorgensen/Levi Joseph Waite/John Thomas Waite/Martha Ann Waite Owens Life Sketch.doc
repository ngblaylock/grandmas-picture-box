{\plain A Biographical Sketch of the Early Life of my Sister Martha Ann Waite Owens\par
}{\plain \tab The subject of this sketch was the first child and only daughter of John Waite and Sarah 
Noble Waite. Born the 2nd of March 1843 at Gosberton, Clough, Lincolnshire, England. \par
}{\plain \tab The Waite family had lived in the Parish of Gosberton for two generations back. The 
Noble family can be traced back to the town of Wyberton. About ten miles distant. Both families 
were known to be honorable, industrious, and hard working people, which made it possible for 
them, by their economy and frugality to make a respectable living. \par
}{\plain \tab Grandfather Waite, in religious matter, leaned toward the Methodist and was a member 
of that Society up to his death, which occurred in his 88th year. Grandmother Waite, whose 
maiden name was Anne Davis, died ten years previous at the age of 8.5 years. Grandfather Noble 
was a Protestant and died at the age of 70 years and Grandmother died at the age of 37 years, left 
a family of six young children, 3 boys and 3 girls. The oldest was only 12 years old, and the 
youngest a baby. \par
}{\plain \tab Father John Waite had five children, four boys and one girl. I am not sure of the exact 
date when the Latter Day Saint Elders came down to Gosberton Risegate. However, the parents 
of Sister Martha Ann were among the first in that vicinity that accepted the Gospel as taught by 
the Mormon Elders. She being a girl of about ten years accepted the Gospel with all her heart 
and faithfully maintained and lived up to its precepts. Ever ready to bear her testimony to its 
Divinity all the day long which brought down on her devoted head the jeers and ridi6ule of her 
companions at school. \par
}{\plain \tab Martha Ann was very studious and painstaking at school, worked hard and faithfully at 
her lessons. Always prepared was her motto. And by her constant application to her books, she 
became among the foremost in school. It became a noted fact that she always stood at the head 
of her class, which fact caused much jealousy and hatred from her classmates. This little black 
eyed Mormon girl, with small classic features, whose black curly hair, out-rivaled the sheen of 
the raven\'92s wing, had much to contend with on that account. However, when the time came for a 
spelling match at the week\'92s end, they all forgot that she was a poor little Mormon girl. They 
only remembered that she was a very good speller and that the side that was fortunate to choose 
her was sure to win while the opposite side would meet with defeat. I remember distinctly many 
times while sitting and looking with intense interest while a very small boy, watching the long 
line of boys and girls spelling or missing the word. But there she stood! Calmly, anxiously, with 
determination flashing from her black eyes waiting for another word, and as soon as the word 
was given it was spelt. The murmur of satisfaction was whispered \'93Patty has won again.\'94 \par
}{\plain \tab \'93But past is all her fame, the very spot where oft she triumphed is forgot.\'94\par
}{\plain \tab What was true about her spelling will hold good in arithmetic. Her classmates knew 
where to go for assistance. The slates would be passed under the desk while she worked any a 
hard. long example for her school friends. \par
}{\plain \tab She had one true and trusted friend, Mr. George Fox, the teacher, who always was very 
proud to exhibit her work to visitors especially when the minister would call. lie would pat her 
on her head and say \'93Your work is excellent\'94. Years after that the writer of this sketch was 
compelled to use a copy book unfinished, also a book that was used to copy all number work of 
hers. I presented the same to Mr. Fox, the teacher, for examination to ascertain If they were 
suitable for me to use. After Mr. Fox looked through carefully both books, he asked me whose 
books are these? I answered, my Sister Martha\'92s. \'93Yes, yes,\'94 he said, I had forgotten her. Martha 
was indeed a very nice little scholar. It is a pity she could not have remained in school longer. 
She would have made her nark In the educational world.\'94 He turned to me, and said, \'93Jose*, you 
have a very fine example set you In those books by your Sister. I hope you will keep them In the 
same condition as they are today, for there is not a blot or stain nor mistake within the lids of 
either book.\'94 \par
}{\plain \tab Some of us backward boys thought Mr. Fox was very unkind and harsh, but Martha could 
not be made to believe anything of the sort. He was to her kindness personified. Always 
approached her with a smile and a kind word. He was a man that loved learning for 1earning 
sake. lie would not, and did not tolerate a shirker. \par
}{\plain \par
}{\plain \'93A man he was, severe and stern to view,\par
}{\plain I knew him veil, and every truant knew\par
}{\plain Well had the boding tremblers leaned to trace\par
}{\plain The day\'92s disasters In his morning face.\par
}{\plain Full well they 1aughed with counterfeited glee\par
}{\plain At all his jokes, for many a joke had he;\par
}{\plain Full well the busy whisper, circling around\par
}{\plain Conveyed the dismal tidings when he frowned.\'94\par
}{\plain \par
}{\plain \tab After school days were ended, she remained at home and faithfully complied with her 
church duties. She possessed a very good voice, and was rated as a nice singer. Her voice would 
be heard every Sunday afternoon and night in the meetings. The meetings were held in her 
Father\'92s house for many years. She was Branch clerk and treasurer, kept all the church books 
and funds, to the time she emigrated to Zion. She would go out with the Elders when they held 
open\_air meetings to sing for them and distribute tracts and sell church works. She deprived 
herself of the joys of the world for the Gospel sake. She seemed indeed to have come out of the 
world In spirit and feeling long before she was permitted to come In person. She seemed to be 
a1most the village scribe for whoever and whenever they wanted a letter written or read, she was 
Invariably sent for and cheerfully responded. So by so doing she made many friends. Her 
services were appreciated if her religion was not. She, like all other girls had her love troubles. 
Her first love was a young maw that was a member of the Church. Very zealous and faithful 
withal. I believe they were promised to each other. He, however, emigrated with the intention 
and promise to send f or her in the near future. However, men sometimes break their promises. 
This young any was not an exception to that rule. After arriving it Utah, letters came with 
regularities for some time. But for some reason afterwards they came with less frequency. It was 
the old, old story. He loved another. But he was magnanimous enough to still retain a corner in 
his heart for her. Would she take second place? That question was answered in the negative. I do 
believe it was the man she had lost faith in and not the principle. Subsequently, She was 
apprenticed to a dressmaker named Mrs. Willows for one year. Martha became a full fledged 
dressmaker. That was before sewing machines were invented, and all sewing was done by hand. 
So Martha became an accomplished needlewoman. She worked around in the neighborhood for 
one shilling per day, she also received three meals per day. She would work from eight o\'92clock 
in the morning to six at night. \par
}{\plain \tab In the year 1865, April 19th, Martha with the rest of the family sustained the loss of a 
parent, viz, a kind and affectionate Father. She was much devoted to him, and no Father was 
more devoted to his daughter than her deceased Father. It seemed that her prospects of ever 
coming to Zion were father away than ever. The fact of losing her Father by death rested very 
heavily on her shoulders. Her sorrow was intense for some time. The Testimony of the Gospel 
stood her well in hand at that frying experience. She passed through and came out of the ordeal 
with a sublimer love and a stronger faith than before in the great tatter Ihy Work. In fact, she 
seemed to have been transformed from a member of the family to the head. She became more 
insistent in her church duties, more exacting with herself, and ever trying to encourage the rest 
of the family to do likewise. \par
}{\plain \tab Mother followed nursing after Father\'92s death, which business took her away from her 
home a great deal of the time. For that reason, Martha seemed at the head. She made a model 
housekeeper, ever kind and obliging to her brothers, washed and patched their clothes, and 
cooked their food. However, we always knew it mattered little to her what might have happened 
to them adversely in this sense of losing a job through dull times. We always received a kind and 
hearty welcome home. There was a strong cord of friendship existing between her brothers and 
herself. \par
}{\plain \par
}{\plain \'93Careless their merits or their faults to scan;\par
}{\plain Her pity gave ere charity began.\'94\par
}{\plain \par
}{\plain \tab In her life there is one important incident I have omitted I will refer to. This happened in 
her school days which subsequently caused her much pain and suffereing for many years. It 
happened this was a group of girls, mome large and others small, in a very boisterous fun 
making spirit, locked arms and tried to throw each other down. In a game like that one can 
readily see that the weakest must go to the wall. Martha being the smallest, fell to the ground 
and all the other girls fell upon her; Her shoulder was twisted under her and broken. Many, any 
nights no sleep came to her eyes for several years. However, in time her arm became stronger 
and later on I doubt if she suffered very much from it, unless she had to do very heavq work. I 
believe that is the chief reason she resolved to become a dressmaker. For in the old world all 
must work if they expect to eat; moreover, the lower class would not be thought respectable if 
they did not qualify themselves to work for a living. \par
}{\plain \tab As years rolled on, Martha became quite useful in the branch. Her merit was recognized 
by the travelling Elders and none more so than by Elder L. W. Shurtliff. They became very good 
friends, and talked, and sang \par
}{\plain \par
}{\plain \'930 Zion, When I Think of Thee.\'94 \par
}{\plain \'93I long for pinions like a dove, \par
}{\plain And often sigh to think that I should be \par
}{\plain So distant from the land I love, etc.\'94 \par
}{\plain \par
}{\plain \tab Subsequently, Elder Shurtliff, who has been President of the Weber Stake of Zion for 
many years, was transferred from the Nottingham Conference to the London Conference, and 
corresponded occasionally with the clerk of the Risegate Branch. And those letters put new life 
and faith into the heart of my sister in the question of \'93When Shall we go to Zion.\'94 And in the 
year 1869, month of September, a letter came from London which bore the good news that 
Mother, Martha and two brothers come quickly for the passage had been arranged for the fout to 
gather to Zion. \par
}{\plain \tab No bride on the morning of her marriage looked more happy than did Martha. She indeed 
was jubilant. The spirit of hope and faith burned with fervent love for her deliverance from 
Babylon, as the old country was thought to be by the faithful saint. \'93Yes, my native land I leave 
thee, for in distant lands to dwell\'94, she murmured. My mother was at the time nursing a cousin 
who lived f our miles away. Martha after answering the letter received from Elder Shurtliff, 
telling him we would all be there on the date appointed, the next thing to do was to notify 
mother. So with hasty steps she brushed the dew away to meet and tell .the good news to her 
mother. Forty five years afterwards, the writer called at the same house to see the same people 
while on a mission to my native land. Lizzie Noble (my cousin\'92s wife) asked me in these words: 
\'93I have often wondered if Martha ever realized one half of what she expected or anticipated 
when she got to Utah. Why, if she had been sure that she would have married into the Royal 
Family, she couldn\'92t have been more happy.\'94 \'93Yes, I answered, \'91She fully realized all she 
anticipated, for she married an honorable, upright man who was true and faithful to her through 
life, and died in full faith of a glorious Resurrection.\'94 \par
}{\plain \tab We sailed from Liverpool in the steamship \'93Minnesota\'94, Guron\'92s line, on the 4th of 
October, 1869. She was sick the entire trip across the ocean, twelve days. Mother took care of 
her all the way. However, arrived at New York viz Castle Gardens. She asked for bread and 
cheese which she seemed to relish very much. In a few days she was well, took train for Utah, 
arrived at Ogden on the 28th day of October 1869. There was a serious accident which occurred 
one hundred miles east of Ogden. Three persons were killed and two others were badly injured. 
Our train telescoped into the one ahead. We were delayed twelve hours, after which we arrived 
at Ogden as described above.\par
}{\plain \tab Our intention was to go South, via American Fork, to some friends whom we knew in 
England. However, Bro. Brigham Dudley of Willard went down to Ogden to try to secure a 
family to rent his farm the coming season. My brothers Levi and myself were sturdy, healthful 
looking boys. Brother Dudley spoke to me, and asked me if I wished a place to work. I answered 
him in the affirmative. Said he, \'93I will furnish you all the land you can tend, and team, etc.\'94 \'93I 
live fifteen miles north of here. The town is named Willard\'94. I found Levi and Mother and 
Martha. We soon agreed to go with him. We piled our trunk and everything we had into his 
wagon and were soon on the way to our unknown homes feeling grateful in our hearts for the 
good friend the Lord had sent us in the person of Bro. Brigham Dudley. We arrived at the farm 
late, nearly midnight. There was a bed in one corner which Martha and Mother slept in. The 
boys occupied the floor. We had our own bedding. The last thing the English people think of 
doing at night is to lock the door. Martha tried to shut the door, However, it fell down. Oh, what 
a change in her countenance now. I really believe she wished for the green lanes of Bonnie 
England. She couldn\'92t sleep in such a place as this, she said. That was the first time I ever heard 
her murmur. Poor girl, she indeed was disappointed. However, we consoled her with the 
statement of Mr. Dudley that if we didn\'92t like the place he would take us back to the train the 
next morning. She said she would surely go for she could never live in a place like this. We piled 
all our trunks one on top of another against the door in lieu of a lock, and retired to bed. Next 
morning, Mr. Dudley took us up to the fort and gave us a square meal, after which we bid them 
all adieu with the intention of going to American Fork. Bear in mind we had all looked up to 
Martha for advice and counsel, for I am sure she had more faith in Mormonism than both us 
boys at that time. \par
}{\plain \tab On our way down to the Hot Springs Station my brother and I thought and talked about 
the matter, with some misgivings. We felt somewhat like the dog in the fable crossing the 
stream. That it would be unwise to give up the substance of a job to chase a shadow way down to 
American Fork. We thought that probably the prospects would not be any better for us, for we 
sensed the fact very keenly that we were strangers in a strange land, and we would not afford to 
throw away the offer of Mr. Dudley. Therefore, after a few minutes of conversation. Martha 
yielded to our way of thinking, and said if we felt that way she would have no more to say. So, 
Bro. Dudley turned the team around and came back to the farm. Martha went to work for Sister 
Dudley for a season. We all fully agreed that the Lord had a hand in keeping us at Willard. We 
found Bro. Robert Holmes and Aunt Betsey, Bro. and Sister Taylor and considerate of us. In fact, 
I have a warm place in my heart for all of the people, for we were hungry and they fed us; we 
were strangers and they took us in. \par
}{\plain \tab In the spring of 187l Martha Ann became the wife of Owen Owens of Willard, one of the 
most honorable and upright man that I ever knew. Their married life was one of perpetual joy. 
Many children blessed their home. Five grew up to man\'92s estate, four girls are now honored 
wives and mothers. Her only son, Jesse W. is also married and has three children. He is highly 
respected in the circle in which he lives. He filled an honorable mission in England a few years 
ago, to the land of his parents. If those that pass to the Great Beyond have cognizance of the acts 
of those that remain, poor Martha\'92s spirit would indeed be proud of her children, especially the 
one that was an ambassador of the Lord Jesus Christ, for his Mother had the profoundest regard 
and esteem for the traveling Elders. There were two or three that died in infancy. I will leave 
space for another to fill.\par
}{\plain \tab Martha became a Sunday School teacher, also assistant secretary in the Female Relief 
Society, and an honored member in the same. However, her life was not always strewn with 
flowers. Sickness and death came unbidden to her home several times. The Government passed 
laws which made her husband a criminal and liable to imprisonment on conviction and her dear 
self a _________, which preyed very heavily on her mind, to see her husband hunted and driven 
from home for carrying out the higher law, even the law which God had revealed anew in this 
dispensation, which law she conscientiously accepted and believed in. But to be branded as a 
wanton, was more than her sensitive nature could stand. Her health was undermined, her spirit 
broken, and her poor heart stretched on the keyboard of human suffering, shortening her days of 
life on earth materially. In the spring of 1888, I think, she moved with her husband and family up 
to Star Valley, Wyoming. There they built a home in a lovely vale of the mountains. Here they 
looked forward in full faith to a happy consummation of a realization to worship God according 
to their own conscience, where none may come to hurt or make afraid. However, a wise 
Providence had ordered it otherwise. The previous trials that she had undergone had sapped her 
vitality beyond the healing point. The spring had passed, the surer was waning when death 
claimed her as his own. She found life\'92s burden two heavy, and being tired and weary laid it 
down to rest. She died in full fellowship in the church, a faithful Latter Day Saint. A kind sister, 
a lovely maiden, a pure high\_minded woman, a true and devoted wife and mother. Her deeds live 
in the hearts of those who knew her best. I don\'92t think she had an enemy or a foe. She indeed 
was a peacemaker. \'93Blessed are the Peacemakers, for they shall be called the Children of God.\'94 \par
}{\plain \tab In conclusion, dear girls, I admonish you as one who knew her best. Follow her example, 
cherish her memory, teach her virtues to your children while they are still small and around your 
knees. She was and is a dear, loving sister to me \'93And ever near us, though unseen, the dear 
immortal spirits tread, for all the boundless universe if live \_\_ there are no dead.\'94 \par
}{\plain \par
}{\plain \tab Dedicated to my sister\'92s children 15 day of March, 1917, I remain your affectionate 
uncle \par
