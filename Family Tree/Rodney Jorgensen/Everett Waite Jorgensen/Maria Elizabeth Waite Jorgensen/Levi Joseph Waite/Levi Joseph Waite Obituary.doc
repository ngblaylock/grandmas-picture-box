}{\plain \tab We have once more been called on to report the death of our number. Viz Levi J. Waite, 
who after a severe sickness of fifteen days, succumbed to the inevitable, at his home in Dayton, 
Idaho, Oneida Co., Idaho. The cause of his death was typhoid fever.\par
}{\plain \tab The subject of this sketch was born at Gosberton Clough, Lincolnshire, England April 6, 
49 years ago.  He emigrated to Utah in the year 1869, Oct. 28. Obeyed the Gospel the same year 
at Willard, Box Elder Co., in which place he lived until the spring of 1871, when he moved to 
Cache Valley, located at Hyde Park and lived there for a number of years. Here he married.\par
}{\plain \tab Subsequently he moved to Five Mile Creek (now Dayton), Idaho where he made his 
home and became identified with the people of that ward.\par
}{\plain \tab It is  eleven years since he lost his wife through confinement,  and was left with five little 
children.  The baby survived its mother six months only.  The following year he married again, 
and as a result of the latter marriage five children were born whose ages range from nine years 
down to the two month old baby, who are left without their natural protector.  "Misfortune: 
seemed to mark him her own." For in his brief life he has had trials and disappointments enough 
to appal a less sturdy heart.  He struggled through failure of crops, drought, loss of stock, 
poverty, sickness and death.  However, through it all he struggled on, hoped on; and his naturally 
buoyant and cheerful spirit never failed him, and his faith in the Gospel and the future was 
immovable.\par
}{\plain \tab His hospitality was proverbial, his native honesty a byword.  His word was his bond; and 
if Levi J. Waite ever broke his word with either friend or foe it was because circumstances made 
it impossible for him to keep it.  His liberality was unbounded.  The stranger's wants were freely 
supplied as those of a blood relation. He delighted in helping others. What he accumulated of 
this world's goods may have been limited, but of that limited quantity many have shared freely 
and without price. His sermons spoke of deeds; his prayers in actions.\par
}{\plain \tab In September of the present year his oldest son was called to fill a mission. After days 
before the time to go he was stricken with typhoid fever, for two months. Subsequently the 
smaller children took it then his: oldest daughter; hence he had sickness for three months, and 
when all thought in a short time they would, be well, the father, worn out with nursing and 
watching his family for nearly three months, took the fever, He unprepared for the attach of so 
malignant a disease, hence his enfeebled condition made him less impregnable, and death 
claimed him as her own, on Wednesday last, November 17, 1897.\par
}{\plain \tab The funeral services were held at the home of the deceased, when the bishopric and 
leading elders of the ward testified of his faithfulness and goodness of heart. A large cortege 
followed his remains to the grave. He was quietly laid to rest beside his faithful wife, who had 
preceded him eleven years, at the Weston Idaho Cemetery.\par
}{\plain \tab He died as he had lived; a faithful Latter-day Saint. Farewell, Brother Levi; sleep in 
peace.  Eternal riches are thine. A widow, nine children and a host friends are left to mourn his 
loss.\par
