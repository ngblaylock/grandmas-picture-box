\par 
\par Grandpa: We got down in that old broken tin granary and built a fire.
\par 
\par Linda: In the granary?
\par 
\par Grandpa: Yeah, yeah, yes sir. Then, we smoked all those dukes on some sacks . . . tried to put the fire out. There was lots of smoke. By then, I couldn\rquote t see. By
 then, we got great big green flames under that granary. The wind took it. . . . the fire . . . The smoke was so bad; . . . By then I was so sick I didn\rquote t care. And that guy, he wasn\rquote t very religious, anyway. He said, \'93can you pray.\'94
 I said, \'93I don\rquote t know if I can or not,\'94 He said, \'93Be quiet, I will.\'94 \'93We better start praying,\'94 he says. \'93We gotta put that fire out or I\rquote ll get a whippen.\'94 So I said, \'93How are we going to do it?\'94 \'93
Throw dirt on it,\'94 he said. Well, we had it right in the middle of a rock pile. So we threw the rocks on it. And it didn\rquote t put the fire out. So he said, \'93We\rquote ll run down the hill (to get some dirt).\'94
 Oh, which pretty near the length of this building (the Elks Hospital). We had to run fast to get it out. . . . It burnt faster. Oh boy!
\par 
\par Linda: Did you get the fire out?
\par 
\par Grandpa: No, we didn\rquote t. Harvey Simons was over there working his grass line and he looked up and he said, \'93Hey you guys\endash put that fire out.\'94 . . . And there we sat. \'93Well, we gotta get this fire out, . . . bags of . . . and
 here comes Harvey Simons.\'94 And I shout, \'93If Dad\rquote s doesn\rquote t whip me this time for this misdemeanor I\rquote d never smoke it again,\'94 and I didn\rquote t. He didn\rquote t whip me and I didn\rquote t smoke no more of this foolishness.

\par }{\ul Moonshine}{
\par 
\par I went with those boys downtown one night. And they had this moonshine. They got a couple of bottle of it. They wanted me to drink with them. I told them I don\rquote 
t want to drink that garbage. You go ahead and drink it and they did and they got drunk. They were drunk. . . . hung around there they were lazy. There you know\endash 
they were truing to sober up so they dared to go home. I finally I took off and went home. And left them.
\par 
\par Mom said, \'93Where have you been?\'94 when I came in. I said I went with the boys downtown \endash  mom said what did you do? Well, I knew right then I\rquote d have to tell her. I said, well they had some moonshine . . . I says well, I didn\rquote 
t drink any but the rest of them did and they are pretty souped up. I said, I didn\rquote t want to stay around there while they sobered up so I came home. Mom to
ld Carlyn and Berdise and they went down and told all the mothers of those kids that their kids had been on a bender. And the they were going to beat me up for telling on them. 
\par 
\par Bryce: If you didn\rquote t get it one way you got it another.
\par 
\par Grandpa: I told them right out, I says, you guy know you are doing wrong so what do you want to beat me up for. You knew better. They kind of cooled down and didn\rquote t beat me up. I didn\rquote 
t go fool with them anymore. Because they wanted to drink and go crazy like that they could do it all by themselves. So I got very unpopular. 
\par 
\par I didn\rquote t like what they were doing to all the girls in the ward anyway. There wasn\rquote t a one of them down there they didn\rquote t play with or whatever you call it.
\par 
\par And I said well, I don\rquote t want any of them anyway \endash  they are second handed. So I wouldn\rquote t go with them and they kept messing with them and finally they went off to Wellsville and found them a wife and left the home kids high and dry 
\endash  and I didn\rquote t think that was good either. I finally moved away and ended up in Riverside and that\rquote s where Mom was, so I married her.
\par 
\par }{\ul 1}{\ul\super st}{\ul  Job
\par }{
\par First job pitching tater bags. Handle very good. 68 cents an hour. And I thought I was doing good. 
\par 
\par Linda: It was in those days.
\par 
\par Grandpa: Boy, I well we could pay our bills and that\rquote s about all. With what we got paid.
\par 
\par How soon was it after you got married that you we to Arco and broke that land out of Sagebrush.
\par 
\par Grandpa: Well, we went up there the first year we were married and that was 1941. Spring of 1941 
we went up there and worked with Wilkee Noble that summer and well between Wilkee and me we got grandpa Moses 80 acres planted and for the next year we moved back to Riverside for the winter. Next year we moved up there in that old ram shock of a house. J
e
sse T came up there with Bings, storming around with little faith that we would get it fixed. So we got one room fixed and moved in. And that was the end of Jesse T. He took off and left me to fix the rest of it. So we plastered and patched the holes in t
he the bedroom, then we had two rooms done and we fixed up another room and we had three rooms. And that was as far as I got. We bought the 40 then so we decided we\rquote 
d ren grandpa Moses place one more year and live there and live there and farm the 40 and I\rquote ll be damed if grandpa didn\rquote 
t sell it out from under us. And left us hight and driy. No house to live in and no nothing. The 40 acres we bought had a one-room.
\par 
\par We were all in that one room and I told Leone, I said, \'93we can\rquote t go on much longer. We can\rquote t li
ve here like this all summer and that was in the spring. I went over to Wilkee and he had a bunch of old beat up cinder blocks. I told him if he would let me use them I would build my house and then in the fall I would replace them when it. .. In the fall
 
when we got that trade done and went down to Boise Payette lumber, only it was in Arco. I knew that guy pretty well and he loaned me about $1,500 worth of credit on lumber and stuff and we built that house on the highway. So between that we had about $5,0
00 in that shock when we got it done. But it was so warm. Wind and snow blowing in the wintertime inside there you couldn\rquote 
t tell if it was whistling or what. We had that warm mouning stove and we could fill that thing full at night and it would burn all night and half the next day and we never got cold in that building. I had it insulated on top 6 inches.
\par 
\par 
\par THIS IS A PAGE OUT OF ORDER:
\par 
\par I bought a real killer diller from that sucker old \'93run away at the drop of a hat.\'94 I hooked him up one day and Brownie together and that was a mistake.
\par 
\par NEW PAGE:
\par 
\par Its about supposed to be 6 inches of insulation in these . . . about that many . . . we put over them we went up there and put some more on top. We put white pine on the ceiling and we didn\rquote t like that so we plaste
red over the top of it. It was really a pretty warm houme with cinder blocks all the way around. It didn\rquote t take much to heat that thing. It the best \endash  the really the best home we\rquote ve ever had except for we built it for a garage.
\par 
\par I ... one two three four ro
oms and a bathroom and the kitchen was last the living south bathroom outside door was right there. You walked in that doorway and was in the living or the Kitchen. The kitchen was here and the livingroom and you could go either way. Most the time we head
ed for the kitchen cause thats where the food was.

\par }{\ul Horses}{
\par 
\par Bryce: Didn\rquote t you have a team of horses when you broke that land down?
\par 
\par Grandpa: 6 head of horses - Chub and Browny. I can\rquote t remember what I called the Chub one, that dirty one.

\par }{\ul Notes}{
\par 
\par Remember 5 more waffles.
\par 
\par Dad and Levi and Leon and two girls were going to Bear Lake. We left early to get a good start when we got into twon we stopped to get something to eat. We went into a restarant and order some waffles. The were hugh and we. When w
e got them eaten, Dad ordered 5 more. There were so sick they upchucked on the way to Bear Lake.
\par Dad tells the time he dove into the water and it was only a foot deep. He skinned his nose and chest.
\par 
\par Dad\rquote s egg allowance. Dad used to get and egg a week and would take it to the store and trade it in on a big candy bar called Big Daddy. And when the chicken\rquote s didn\rquote t lay enough we didn\rquote t get anything.
\par 
\par On the fourth of July, we got a nickle and we were told not to spend it all in one place. 
\par 
\par We walked everywhere we went. When we went to school we took our lunch for the whole family wrapped in newspaper, tied in a string. When it was lunch time the whole family would gather together to eat lunch.
\par 
\par Dad went out to get on Happy their family pony. He was going to show aunt Amy how Tom Micks rode his horse. The minute dad hit the saddle, the pony took off straight for the close line, swept him off and left him on his rear.
\par 
\par }{\ul Mustang Story in Nevada with my Dad}{
\par 
\par My grandpa and Uncle Merv, Uncle Orin and Dad would go to
 Nevada to round up wild mustangs and bring them to Hyde Park and green break them and sell them to people in town for work horses. They would sell them in teams for about 500 a team. One by one people started buying tractors and that ended the horse deal
.
\par 
\par My mother would catch me out there peeking in the corrals and would be scared to death. I was just a little kid then. 
\par 
\par Hyde Park, Dad and I was sawing the tree down cutting down the poplar tree. Uncle Darrel and 
Uncle Mervin were holding the rope. They got the tree swaying. When the tree was ready, Uncle Darrell went one way and Uncle Mervin the other and the tree caught Uncle Merv.
\par 
\par Apple Valley, Lolanne starting the D.C. case. The tractor was new. 
\par 
\par Lolanne running the SC tractor over the hill.
\par 
\par Hyde Park, An incident with the pine hen. I went walked up the ridge all alone to the ridge to poach a pine hen. I got all the way up to the ridge and didn\rquote t see a pine hen (there was a skiff of snow).  So I turned around
 and in my tracks I saw the biggest Mountain Lion tracks I ever saw. He jumped off the trail and into the bushes. I got off the Mountain as fast as I could and didn\rquote 
t feel good until I passes through the gate on Cedar Hill. The cat had followed me 400 feet and I didn\rquote 
t know it. I lost all interest in poaching Pine Hens. Pine Hens should stand there and let you shoot them. If you missed they would let you shoot again. I got out in the open away from trees and ran as fast as I could.
\par 
\par When I went to get my blessing I had a queer sensation I never forgot. I haven\rquote 
t told many people. I went to Harvey Session place in Logan. I rode the pony down and tied her up to a tree. I went in and he set me up on a stool. It was so high I set my feet on a ring. The minute he
 started that blessing it felt like we were carried away on a high pinicle. It was scary. Whe it was all over he said \'93amen\'94 and I felt like we were in the room again.
\par 
\par }{\ul Saturday Night Baths}{
\par 
\par When we were kids we would start with the little one first and then we would add hot water to the tub when it got cold so we wouldn\rquote t have to pack the water. The bigger kids would pack their own water so they wouldn\rquote 
t have to bathe in the other kids water.
\par 
\par We bathed in the kitchen in the galvanized tub next to the stove and put wood in the stove to make it warmer. We each had our own towel. We used regular hand soap to take a bath but mom made home-made soap to wash clothes with.
\par 
\par Everytime we killed a pig or cow we saved the fat and rendered it out and made soap.

\par }{\ul Impressions from Bryce \endash  March 1988}{
\par 
\par As a very young boy my first impressions of my father was that he was a warm and loving person. Dad was always willing to take Rod and I with him everwhere he went. That is why I can 
remember catching trout in the irrigation ditch with a shovel. I can remember standing on the wagon holding to the reins of our team during thrashing time as Dad would walk along throwing the shucks of grain with his fork. I remember the thrill when the t
eam got the chich chich they would walk forward until Dad would \'93woa\'94
 them down. We really thought we were driving and it was a thrill. When dad bought his first farm, all he would let us stand between his legs and hang on to the steering wheel. During mowi
ng time as the hay fell behind the cutter bar and I would jog along and at times we would stop, bunch the hay up and jump on it. Now, even during winter time, I can still smell the freshly mown hay. I remember ghow great it was to grab his hand when he wo
u
ld throw his shovel over his shoulder go to irrigate. I remember how long his stride was and hoped someday I could stride like he had. One really special memory from thanksgiving and Christmas was that Dad would sing or from Christmas carols or Church hym
ns. Even at other times you could hear him singing a happy tune. I used to think that\rquote s why Dad went to Church, so he could sing to us on the way to and from.
\par My father had very little tolerance for disobedience, and although he corrected us many times, he 
still had the ability to give us warmth and love. One day dad went to caldwell to see the FmhA, while he was done I was suppose to mow hay. I mowed about 5 minutes of that whole afternoon and when Dad arrived home and found not only the mowing undone and 
a
lso the mower broke down he was furious. He took the pitman stick or what was left and broke it again over my backside. I was very stunned over the whole affair and I can still remember how sorrowful I was about letting my father down by not following thr
ough with my job.
\par 
\par I remember many experiences working on projects with my Dad or uncle Levi. My father always had a project of some sort or other. Leveling land, building on the house, picking spuds or corn, shoveling ditch, building a beet cultavator, and
 many, many other. Our chance to slip away into idleness was very slim. I can even remember working till two in the morning to repair a clutch or the truck so we would have it back into the corn field the next morning. Later, now that I have boys, I appre
ciate his ability to always have something for us to do.}{
