{\plain Leone Moses Jorgensen -- Parma, Idaho\par
}{\plain \par
}{\plain Immediately after our graduation I went to school in Pocatello for one year. The things that 
highlighted that year were the rewarding oppor\-tunities which were given me such as giving a 
facial to a lady who came in with a bad headache - watching her relax and fall asleep and wake 
up with the headache gone. Then I had a weekly schedule with three or four bald headed men 
who came (in despair) for an ultra treatment to try and restore their charm. It was fun and funny 
but nevertheless did some good.\par
}{\plain \par
}{\plain The following summer Everett and I dated and were married in November of that fall (1940). 
We were married in the Logan Temple. The following spring we went to Lost River to farm. We 
had lots of fun fishing, even on the Mackey Dam. We lived there eleven years. We bought eighty 
acres of farm ground while there. The winter of 1951 we had so much snow that we decided to 
find a warmer climate - thank goodness.\par
}{\plain \par
}{\plain With the goodness of the Lord we managed to keep our farming and finances on the up while we 
raised our seven children -- all of whom have had a temple marriage. Everett, our three sons, and 
four sons-in-law have all served in missionary work. All of the grandsons have served missions 
as they became of age. Just this month I have seen our first two grandchild\-ren married in the 
Mesa and Boise Temples.\par
}{\plain \par
}{\plain One of the more fun type church activities that we accomplished was when we taught and took a 
group of young people from Lost River Stake to participate in the June Conference dance 
festival in Salt Lake City. One of the most hilarious trips we went on was when Everett and I, 
our youngest daughter Gaynel, and son Jesse, our youngest married daughter Jolene and her 
husband Kent, my sister and her husband whom we hadn\'92t ever met before all got in our new 
station wagon and went to the world's fair in Spokane.\par
}{\plain \par
}{\plain At the present time we have thirty-six living grandchildren (lost one at birth). We\'92ll probably see 
many vocations in life within the confines of our family. One is already on his way to being a 
doctor and has married into the family of the Vice-President of the Aloe Vera Corporation. 
They\'92re really great people.\par
}{\plain \par
}{\plain As a family we\'92ve had many cherishable memories right here on our own place - both in work 
and play. For the past two years Everett managed his business from his little corner in the dining 
room where he chose to go because of health problems. From there he could see most of what 
was going on out doors. When we reached our goal, we sold our cow herd. This was less than 
eight months ago.\par
}{\plain \par
}{\plain When Everett passed away in February 1988, he left me with an out-of-debt home, and 120 acre 
farm. He was a hard-working husband. There aren\'92t words to write the tribute I would pay to 
him. It comes from the language of the heart. And in conclusion I will say that in cherished 
thought and memory loved ones never really part.\par
