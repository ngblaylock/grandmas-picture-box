}{\plain Jesse Tilten Moses was to son of Jesse Tilten Moses, Sr. and Phoebe Arabell Woodruff. He was 
born January 28, 1878, in Big Cottonwood, Utah. When he was about three years old his parents 
were called down to Mesa, Arizona, to help settle that country. His father freighted a lot. When 
he would come home from a trip he used to take Jesse and put him on his back and swim across 
the river. When he would get almost to the other side he would shake him off his back and make 
him paddle to shore. So he loomed to swim when he was about three years old.\par
}{\plain \par
}{\plain His mother\'92s health was not very good as the weather was so hot, so they moved back to 
Smithfield for a few years. Here Jesse went to District school. He also occasionally went fishing 
with his-grandfather Woodruff. They would go down to the creek for a few hours and would 
bring home a moss of trout.\par
}{\plain \par
}{\plain As his mother did not have very good health he used to help her with the house work. One 
morning he was late for school and the teacher said the reason Jesse was late for school was that 
he had to wash the dishes for his mother. This made him angry so he gathered up his books and 
walked out of school and would not go back again that year. For the rest of the year he helped 
his father on the farm.\par
}{\plain \par
}{\plain His father was a partner in a co-op store there at Smithfield. They also had a fruit orchard. They 
used to raise a lot of apples and gave the Indians apples off a certain free every year.\par
}{\plain \par
}{\plain The next year he went to school at Big Cottonwood. He stayed with his Uncle Fred and Aunt 
Martha Moses. They were neither one ever married. They raised chickens and milked cows so 
sold eggs and butter which Aunt Martha made. Every weekend he would take a load into Salt 
Lake and sell it. They made quite a lot of money this way.\par
}{\plain \par
}{\plain Jesse had to walk to school several miles away. The snow was quite deep sometimes and Uncle 
Fred would let him take his horse and buggy and drive to school.\par
}{\plain \par
}{\plain Ho later went to school at Provo and stayed with his Grandma Sarah Woodruff. There he took 
Seminary and was prepared to go on a mission. He was called to go in 1898. He fulfilled a two-year mission in the Central States. In that day they had to fill a mission without purse or script so 
he only received $15.00 a month to fill his mission.\par
}{\plain \par
}{\plain Soon after be returned home he developed chills and fever. An old lady friend of the family 
doctored him with herbs. He soon got better but was very weak for a long time.\par
}{\plain \par
}{\plain He then went to the Agriculture College in Logan. Afterwards he taught school for two years. 
Then in September 21, 1903, he was married to Lavina Harper, his childhood sweetheart, in the 
Salt Lake Temple. They had gone to school together when they were younger. They wrote and 
saw each other occasionally but they both went with other girls and boys. They seemed meant 
for each other so they were happy in their married life. They raised a family of nine children; 
one baby, Erma, died when a few months old. Their children were Mary H., Jesse Harper, 
Arabell, Lavina, Vilate, Charles, Erma, Tern and Leone. Vilate and Fern both died in their early 
married life.\par
}{\plain \par
}{\plain After Jesse and Lavina were married, they lived in Smithfield where he worked with his father 
on a farm. He also worked in a brick factory for $1.00 a day. He built himself a brick home with 
two rooms. He also worked as a salesman selling books. One day when he was working on the 
farm he walked out of a gate and a pole fell on his head and knocked him out for several days. 
He then had to quit his job selling books.\par
}{\plain \par
}{\plain There in Smithfield their first five children were born. He taught school another year. He was a 
good teacher. The trustees wanted him to keep on teaching as he was very good with the pupils, 
but he said it made him too nervous and he wanted to get out in the open air. So he went to 
Nevada and took up homesteading. He put in a crop there but the rabbits were so thick they ate 
all their crops up. This discouraged him and they moved back to Idaho. While they lived in 
Metropolis, Nevada, Erma and Charles were born. While in Nevada all the children came down 
with scarlet fever. His sister Sylvia had made a homestead there to help nurse them back to 
health.\par
}{\plain \par
}{\plain They then moved back to Lost River and bought a farm and house there. The snow was so deep 
he had to take his children to school on a sleigh. Their last two children, Fern and Leone, were 
born here at Lost River, Idaho. When Leone was born, he had to go after a midwife in a sleigh 
because the snow was too deep for horse and buggy.\par
}{\plain \par
}{\plain He rented aid worked on several farms and bought some good milk cows during the depression 
of 1919 but had to sell them at a very low price. He bought some land at Riverside, Idaho, and 
built a four-bedroom home on it--two bedrooms in the basement.\par
}{\plain \par
}{\plain Jesse\'92s son Charles and daughter Lavina filled a mission and his daughter Arabell went to a 
business school and worked in the Logan Temple as a typist for about six years.\par
}{\plain \par
}{\plain They lived in the basement of their home for several years and while Charles was on a mission 
Jesse finished off the top part of the house, even making the cabinet work in it. He was very 
handy with tools as he took carpenter work in school. Since coming to St. George he has built 
me several cupboards and a fruit room.\par
}{\plain \par
}{\plain When Jesse\'92s a wife Lavina became mentally ill for about ten years before she died, he had his 
daughter Mary and her husband Earl Durrant come and live in the basement of his home and 
help take care of her mother. For her service he deeded his house aid one acre to her. They later 
bought the remaining eighty acres.\par
}{\plain \par
}{\plain In the winter of 1955, to avoid a nervous breakdown, he went to Mesa, Arizona, to work in the 
temple. His sister Sylvia lived with him for four years helping him. In 1956 after his wife Lavina 
died, he and Sylvia went to the St. George Temple to do some work. It was there he met me, 
Harriet Barnum Cardon. We did a lot of sealings and temple work together so became quite fond 
of each other. We were married June 8, 1960, in the St. George Temple.\par
}{\plain \par
}{\plain The first year of our married life we visited the Idaho, Los Angeles and Mesa Temples. We also 
visited with our children in Idaho, Washington, Sacramento, Los Angeles and Las Vegas, 
Nevada. The second year of our marriage Jesse had an operation for prostrate gland trouble but 
progressed very well. About two years later I broke my leg and also had gall stones so had to 
have an operation to have them removed. Jesse was very helpful in taking care of me. He was 
always quite healthy except for when he would get a spell of bronchitis. He would have to take 
penicillin to cure it. In 1962 Jesse went to Dr. Chatterley and found he had glaucoma in his eyes. 
They were so bad the doctor could not help him very much, so he had to use drops in his eyes the 
rest of his life. I also had hemorrhages in my eyes, so in October 1967 I went to Denver and had 
an eye operation for a detached retina. When my granddaughter Anita was married, I was too ill 
to attend the wedding.\par
}{\plain \par
}{\plain On January 28, 1968, when Jesse was 90 years old we had an open house for him aid hundreds 
of his friends came to wish him a happy birthday. We spent the following year continuing 
working in the temple, doing endowments and hundreds of sealings together for the dead. We 
also visited with our children in Idaho, Washington aid Sacramento and occasionally we went to 
Phoenix.\par
}{\plain \par
}{\plain December 28, 1968, as I was walking down the church steps I fell and fractured my left hip. I 
was in the St. George Hospital three weeks and the doctor could not do anything to help me, so I 
was taken to Salt Lake to the Holy Cross Hospital. There I was operated on and a steel ball was 
put in my hip. The night before the operation my son LaRue and his wife Wanda came to see me 
and he and Jesse and Jesse\'92s grandson, Wayne Noses, administered to me and gave me a 
blessing aid I got along fine. In two weeks I was able to walk in a walker and go home. My 
daughter Helen and husband Melvin Monson came to see me and brought me home. I was 
blessed aid able to go about my work again in a few weeks. I have to use a cane and will 
probably have to for the rest of my life. During our marriage of eleven years I have had four 
operations aid Jesse was very good to me and stood by my side and helped me gain my health 
again.\par
}{\plain \par
}{\plain We tried to attend all our grandchildren\'92s weddings in the Idaho, Salt Lake and Oakland 
Temples. Jesse has had 31 grandchildren aid two great grandchildren get married; All except 
three have been married in the temple. All of my nine grandchildren that have been married have 
been married in the temple. Jesse has had ten grandsons serve full\'97time missions, while five of 
my grandsons have served missions.\par
}{\plain \par
}{\plain Jesse and I lived together for eleven happy years and he was quite healthy and strong except for 
his eyesight. In September 1970 he developed diarrhea and was ill until June 17, 1971, when he 
passed away. I also had the shingles during that winter and was sick for several months. About a 
month before he passed away his daughter Arabel Noble came down aid stayed a week to help 
take care of him. His daughter Lavina came occasionally and stayed overnight to help me with 
him. About a hundred of his and my relatives attended the funeral.\par
}{\plain Jesse was a very good man. He and Lavina raised a good family. He worked in the Church all his 
life. He filled a mission, was a class teacher in Sunday School, then later bishop\'92s councilor. He 
was on the finance committee to help build their chapel at Riverside and later was a high 
councilman. After his wife passed away in 1956 he was set apart as an officiator in the Idaho 
Falls Temple for the washing and anointing. He has also done a lot of temple work. We have 
done thousands of endowments and sealings together. He left a posterity of 6 living children, 37 
grandchildren and 80 great grandchildren. I have 4 living children, 17 grandchildren and 19 great 
grandchildren.\pard \sl0\tx0\tx720\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\tx3600\tx4320\tx5040\tx5760\tx6480\tx7200\tx7920\tx8640\tx9360
