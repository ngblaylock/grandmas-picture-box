}{\plain \tab On the 10}{\plain \super th}{\plain   of March 1960 my grandson, Wilford Durrant and I started for California in 
his little red foreign ears  We went as far as Las Vegas, Nev.  We called on Murray Harper, spent 
a few minutes with them, then visited some of the machine shops for a job. Wilford was just out 
of school and broke, He was anxious to get to work so he could start school next winter, About 
five o'clock in the evening we started for Las Angeles, arriving there at eleven that night, at the 
home of his brother, Ronald. We stayed with Ronald until after priesthood meeting and Sunday 
Schools. Wilford then returned to Las Vegas.  I stayed with Ronald and Anna May until Tuesday 
morning.  I left on the bus and went to Downey and stayed with Elmer and Maud until Friday,  
Thursday Elmer, Maud and I took a trip to Disney Land.  Disney Land is Walt Disney\'92s dream of 
a recreation center.  I was much impressed with its imaginative glamor. As I traveled around in 
the various sections and saw all the wealth and excitement of it I could not help but contrast it 
with the calm spirit and peace of mind I get in my labors in the temple.  How different are the 
ways of man and those of the Lord.\par
}{\plain \tab On Friday Ruth Marie invited myself, Elmer, and Maud, also her mother and sister Carol 
to dinner,  I stayed that night with Ruth and Harry and the next morning went with their bishop 
to the Los Angeles temple.  This was their first trip to the Los Angeles temple,  Mar 19, 1960 I 
went through two sessions and was invited to a marriage ceremony in the ceiling room, After 
this was over I boarded a city bus and went to the Grey Hound Bus  Depot, some five miles 
distance.  In looking through the telephone directory I ran on to Ella Fords (Daves\'92 daughter) 
name and called her up. She and her boy friend came right over and got me.  We Spent a most 
pleasant evening.  I stayed at her place that night.  The next morning she took me to the bus.  I 
bought a ticket to Sacramento.  I called Eunice and Keith Wilcox.  They were busy and could not 
come to get me so they called Dave and Win.  They were out babysitting, but they called David 
and his wife Ruth came to the depot and picked me up.  I stayed that night with Dave and Win. 
The next two days I went fishing with them but had no luck. While there I got to see all of 
Dave\'92s family that were in those parts.  As I had to go back to Los Angeles on my way home I 
took the shore line to Santa Monica.  While there I visited with Thelma and Marilyn for a day or 
so.  I took a 2 o'clock bus for home after a two hours ride in the desert, the bus quit on us, The 
driver had to send back for another bus to pick us up.  It put us into Las Vegas at ten in the 
morning. While in Las Vegas I visited and old friend, Mrs. Tuttle (Ora Allen).  We talked about 
old times in Metropolis, now a ghost town. Sunday evening of the 9th of April I spent a few 
minutes with Nelle Nordine, she talked about her love and affection for grandfather Wilford 
Woodruff.  She had a book, \'93The Story of Atkinville,\'94 A one family village, four or  five miles 
west of St, George, I will copy that portion of it that gives the account of Wilford Woodruff\'92s 
visits there.\par
}{\plain \tab WiLford Woodruff wrote in his diary December 31,1886: The year 1886 is passed and 
gone,  It has been an important year in the history of the Latter-day Saint Church.  It has sent to 
prison hundreds of leading men of the church and driven into exile the presidency and the twelve 
apostles and many other leading men, all for obeying the celestial law of God and the Patriarchal 
order of marriage.\'94\par
}{\plain \tab How Wilford Woodruff became acquainted with the Atkin family we do not know. He 
visited St. George in Dec. 1883, but the first available record of visiting the Atkins that we found 
in his journal is dated Jan 26, 1885, in which he states that he and George Teasdale sent with 
William H Thompson to Price City and dined with William Atkin, visited his fish pond and 
returned home.  From then on he was closely associated with the Atkins.\par
}{\plain \tab His daily journal shows that during his exile he was hiding in the St George or Dixie 
region from Jan 20 to Nov 2, 1885 and from Aug 7, 1886 to July 16 1887.  He maintained his 
headquarters in St George during his first period of hiding and part of the second.  During this 
time he made 17 occasional trips to Atkinsville.  He made his headquarters at Atkinsville from 
Nov 22 to Dec 3, 1886 and from Feb 26 to June 7 1887, during which time he made seven trips 
to St. George.  His trips to St, George from Atkinsville usually lasted from two to four days.  
Joseph Walker remarked (letter, 21 Mar 1951) "It was no small honor, even as it was a heavy 
responsibility, to have such an eminent man\'92s safety and welfare entrusted to this family. His 
residency lent luster and added importance to the place, beyond anything else that could have 
happened to the villages. Here came the church mail. Hundreds of letters which he answered. 
Most of his time was devoted to church business. To paraphrase Isaiah (II:3), Out of Mormon, 
dixie went forth the law of the church and the word of the Lord from Atkinsville.\par
}{\plain \tab While Woodruff used St, George as headquarters, he leaned heavily upon Thomas P, 
Cottan for advice and guidance in finding safe places to stay and avoid detection, One of the 
places that he found safe and congenial was the Squires home at 615 E 100 N St. in St. George. 
Woodruff states in his journal on 7 Aug 1886: \'93Arrived at St George and slept at the home of 
John and Emma Squires In the same bed where I had slept for six months last year.\'94 Emma 
Squires (Little) told the writers (interview, 20 Apr 1956) that when Woodruff lived in her place, 
he had a room upstairs where he always retreated when someone knocked, before she opened the 
door,  She had to be very careful no to let anyone know he was there,  The home was near the 
red hill and had orchards and vineyard at the rear of the house where Woodruff occasionally 
went hunting quails in a disguise that Emma made for him, a sunbonnet, and a mother hubbard 
dress,  Despite the disguise, and inquisitive neighbor met and recognized him in the rear of the 
house as he was returning from the hill.  He had to find a new place to live immediately. This 
may have been the impelling reason that sent him to Atkinsville.\par
}{\plain \tab The reason why Woodruff visited or moved to Atkinsville on given dates are not clearly 
revealed in his journal although a few hints are given.  For example, he states Feb 23, 1887:   
"Marshal Armstrong arrived in the evening in St, George.\'94 Three days later, 26 Feb 1887, he 
stated  "I took my bed and luggage with brother Thompson and went to William Atkins to stop 
awhile, He stayed more than; three months.  Further light is shed by his statement on Jan 31, 
1885. \'93I rode to brother Atkins, visited his pond; Two boys set fire to his rushed ana flags 
(cattails) and burned things all around his pond so there is no place to hide to shoot ducks or for 
any other purpose;"  He did not visit Atkinsville again until June 29 after the tules (cattails and 
rushes) had regrown.\par
}{\plain \tab The best explanation of his visits and retreats to Atkinsville is supplied by the Atkin 
family tradition, It was these safest place he would find in the region.  He developed confidence 
in the hospitality, dependability and loyalty of the family. Besides, there were thickets of tamarix 
lining the river bottom, lands and the tulies of the pond into which he could quickly flee with 
little fear that the marshals could find him.  In addition, the big majority of the people were loyal 
Latter-day Saints, who faithfully entered the conspiracy to assist the harassed brethren. They felt 
no guilt and no embarrassment in thus helping " the work of the Lord.\'94 A few malcontents and 
unsympathetic non\_members aided the marshals, but the great majority passed word of their 
whereabouts by way of the grapevine. Emma Squires Little said that her father, Wm. Thompson, 
regarded himself as Woodruff\'92s bodyguard and was especially vigilant in keeping track of the 
marshals.  Urgent information was passed to the Atkins by young Will Thompson who traveled 
on back roads or trails. An alert at Atkinsville started a chain reaction.  Nellie says (7 Apr 1956) 
that she was dispatched to the hill top east of the house where she could watch the approaching 
roads.  If she spotted the buggy of Marshals, McGreary and Armstrong coming around the 
dugway above Bloomington or coming down the Price road, it was a signal for the next step. 
Hyrum says (5 May 1956) there was then a rush to get Brother Woodruff, his bedroll, food and 
water, his books and fishing tackle into the large boat (l4 by 5 ft.) on the pond where he could 
remain safely concealed in the heavy cattails and rushes. When asked if the marshals could see 
him from the bluff above the pond, he said there were plenty of places to hide where neither the 
marshals from the hill, the devil from below, nor the Lord from above could see the boat. When 
the danger was past, William went out to the pond, made a noise like a duck, and Woodruff gave 
a signal quack in reply.\par
}{\plain \tab A raid that took place after Woodruff had left Dixie is reported in the St. George Stake 
History (Church Historical Library), as follows, 2 Sep 1887. "Early this morning, one of James 
G. Bleak\'92s homes was visited by deputy marshals. They then went to D.D. McArthur\'92s home and 
one went in; the others kept watch outside.  From there to A. R. Whitehead\'92s home and 
searched.  Then to Ed A. Hendrix and searched.  Then to James Booth's; no arrests; left the city 
without waiting for breakfast.\'94 Woodruff mentions nothing intelligible in his journal about such 
relations with the marshals, although there are drawings and shorthand symbols in certain places 
in his journals which we are told at the church historical library could not be interpreted. 
However, in his letters to the Atkins written after he returned to Salt Lake City, he gave some 
clues to they had done in giving him sanctuary from the marshals.  While all the Atkins were 
alert and felt personal responsibility for his safety, Nellie's childish adoration of  \'93Grandpa 
Allen\'94 as she called him, is especially appealing to him. In one of his letters (3 Sep1887) 
addressed to her he said, \'93I read it (your letter) in the presence of some apostles and a room full 
of people and they were much pleased.  They thought you was a brave young lady who was 
willing to do so much to defend the life and interest of the President of the Church,  But I don't 
wish to put my little lady Nellie to so much trouble and danger. I have a large stout man who 
goes with me everywhere night and day, carries two pistols and a double\_barrel shotgun and says 
he will shoot the marshals if they come to take me. (Don't tell anybody of this)  So I am pretty 
well guarded. I miss you in buttoning up my shoes. I don't stop at home any nights so Alice 
(Wilford's daughter) can't button my shoes and I have to ask some big man that will weigh about 
200 1bs. to button my shoes and he is so awkward about it, I wish I had my Nellie with me.\'94 I (J. 
T. Moses) read the above letter on one of my visits to Nellie's home here in St. George last 
winter. I, being a grandson of Wilford Woodruff, she took special delight in talking to me.\par
}{\plain \tab In his journal, Woodruff referred to forty visits to the Atkin pond, twelve from St. 
George, twenty eight from Atkinsville, some of these were doubtless for hunting and fishing 
only, but there is no certain way of distinguishing them from the trips for hiding, for he often 
fished or hunted to while away the time of waiting. Usually, he indicated the number of fish or 
ducks that he took during his visits to the pond, even if he did not get anything, but on 8 March 
1887 he remarked only: \'93I went on to the pond with my boat a part of the day", and on Mar 24, "I 
went onto the pond in the afternoon.\'94 Whether these are significant remarks is not known. Most 
of Woodruff's days at Atkinsville were busy ones, filled with incessant letter writing, visiting 
with church emissaries or other indoor activities.  However for exercise, he interrupted his 
church duties once or twice a week to hunt in the hills or fields; fish and hunt waterfowl from 
the boat on the pond.   For a man, of 80 years of age he was unusually active, although, 
occasionally he recorded that he came home very tired.  A good nights sleep seemed to restore 
his vigor.  There were days when groups of people from town came to Atkinsville for picnics 
which made it necessary for him to stay in his room, a virtual prisoner, which was indeed a trial 
to him. While Woodruff was in Atkinsville, the Atkin family was very solicitous about his 
welfare, Henry T. explained (1937) "All of us children knew he was in the home and we were 
proud to have our home selected for this purpose of keeping him in seclusion. We would have 
stood almost any torture before we would have exposed President Woodruff.\par
}{\plain \tab William Atkin built an additional room on his house for the accommodation of 
grandfather, while in Dixie. It seems probable that this room was built soon after his hurried 
return for the second time on Feb 26, 1887, three days after Marshal Armstrong arrived in St. 
George. On his two to four day trips to St. George during his second sojourn at Atkinsville, he 
spent most of his time in the St. George temple, in a room which was prepared for his own use. 
(I, J. T. Moses, have been in his room a number of times, have sat in his chair, and reclined on 
his cot.  As I sat there and meditated over the marvelous visions he had, some coming to instruct 
him, others demanding the keys to open the prison doors, releasing them from their flight of 
darkness and filling their souls with hope and joy for light and everlasting life. \par
}{\plain \tab Emma Squires Little (in 1956) stated that her father had trap door under his desk that led 
to secret hiding places. Apropos of this type of seclusion is a story told of a Swiss Bishop from 
Santa Clara, who said in a prayer in Sunday Meeting, \'93. . . and bless the marshals that they may 
not find Brother Woodruff, who is hiding in the St. George temple.\'94 That these were grim and 
desperate times is attested by an incident reported by Joseph Walker (letter, Apr 26 1956). His 
father, Charles L. Walker was the night guard at the temple from the time of its completion in 
1877 to the time of his death in 1904. He possessed a beautiful Colts revolver and powder horn 
that he had purchased in St. Louis on his way to Utah in 1855. On both the horn and the handle 
of the revolver were carved in his typical hand writing, CLW 1855, with St. Louis added on the 
horn. Joseph states: \'93My father was a good shot\'96at 30 paces he could place a slug between the 
eyes of a fattened hog or pick a chicken hawk off the tall ash trees at the back of the lot. Father's 
revolver always lay at hand beside the big Bible in his hut at the temple. When the \'93Feds\'94 were 
on the loose in town, he often told me as we walked around the temple at night, \'93I have my 
orders.\'94 He went into no further detail. \'93Whenever Wilford Woodruff or other 'high authorities' 
were on the 'underground' in St. George, his trusty colts must always be in place behind his waist 
band\'96on the left side, just beyond the mid\_line where his right hand could most quickly grasp it, 
and loaded. \'93He often told me that when Wilford Woodruff came from his rendezvous at 
Atkinsville to spend some time in the temple, to get exercise, (he) would walk around the temple 
building while father patrolled.  They timed their walking speed so that each was opposite the 
other\'96so that if a prowling 'Fed' (should come) upon Woodruff, he (would be) within easy range 
of the deadly colts revolver.\'94\tab \tab \tab \tab \tab \par
