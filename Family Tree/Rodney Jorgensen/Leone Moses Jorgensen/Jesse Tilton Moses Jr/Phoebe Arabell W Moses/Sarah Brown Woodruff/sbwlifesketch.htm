<p>I was born January 1, 1834 in Henderson, Jefferson County, New
York. I was the daughter of Harry and Rhoda Brown. I was born in
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. After my father
started with Zion&#146;s Camp in Missouri my mother came to
Kirtland, Ohio. While there, Joseph Smith, father of the Prophet
and first Patriarch of the Church, gave me a great and glorious
blessing with many promises. One was that I should be the Savior
of my father&#146;s house. I am the only living person of my
father&#146;s house in the Church except my posterity. </p>

<p>When I was three years old my father, after being mobbed and
robbed of all he had, moved to Jefferson, Ohio, where his father
helped him.</p>

<p>I started my education at the age of six years, completed the
district school at 14. I took out a teacher&#146;s certificate
two years later, and taught school the following year. Now as we
began to prosper, my parents became uneasy and the spirit of
gathering with the Saints rested upon them to the extent that
they sold out and in December 1851 we started to Utah which made
our hearts rejoice exceedingly. We came seventeen miles by team
to Painsville, took cars to Cincinnati, then took a steamer to
Louisville, Kentucky. We stayed at New Albany three months on
account of the river being frozen up. Leaving in March, we went
to St. Lewis in a steamer when we met a company of Saints. When
they were organized, all went on that ill fated steamer, the
ASaluda. The boat captains&#146; patience gave out as we had been
on the boat nine days and he got tired waiting for the ice to
melt, so on the third of April 1852 he said we will start today
if we blow the old boat to Hell, and in a few minutes it was
blown somewhere with the poor captain blown all to atoms and
nearly all the officers were killed. The forward cabin was
entirely blown to splinters not a timber standing. The captain
stood on the hurricane deck over the boiler. His remains were
blown three quarters of a mile Over 100 persons were killed and
many crippled. A family of five was all killed. Our famous
pioneer stage actor, Wilman C. Dunkay and his wife and two
children, all the relatives he had were blown into the river and
never found. One lady had her babe killed in her arms and both
legs were broken. Her husband and three little ones by her side
were killed--only leaving her two half-grown girls of her husband.
Something struck me on the brow knocking me senseless. Mother and
my two sisters were not up yet as it was early in the morning, so
they were not hurt, but my father stood over the provision box
over the hatchway getting baby brother a piece. He and the baby
were thrown into the hole among a great mass of debris. He
scrambled out beginning calling for his family. He found all but
the baby. Finally a call came from below, APapa here I am. Out of
the hole they pulled him not hurt, but my fourteen-year-old
brother had his mouth cut all to pieces, all his front teeth
knocked out and his right leg broken, but my dear father was hurt
inwardly. He kept around about three weeks, then just as we
started on the 20th of April, on another boat he became
unconscious with brain fever and left us just as we landed at
Council Bluffs on the 24th of April.<sub> </sub>They took mother
and the children from the boat, leaving me alone with my beloved
dead until four o&#146;clock in the afternoon as mother had to be
with my poor brother.</p>

<p>There was so much grief for everyone there was no one to keep
me company and a tipsy man came on board, uncovered my father&#146;s
face and laughed and frightened me. A gentleman saw him, collared
and threw him to one side and said if he came back to call for
help and I will throw him into the river. Father was buried at
Council Bluffs on the 25th of April from the home of Brother
Green who afterwards lived in Smithfield. We stayed at Council
Bluffs until the 12th of July, then we crossed the river and
started on the plain. My brother Ira was so bad he had to have
part of the wagon, and it was so crowded Apostle Benson took me
to another company; Henry Millers. Ira&#146;s leg did not heel,
and it was so hot traveling it mortified and all his toes dropped
off, so mother had to stay with him and the children at Fort
Laramie and have his leg amputated at the hip.</p>

<p>So I arrived in Utah one year before my mother. Our captain
was exceedingly kind and careful of his company and much beloved.
I have seen him standing by a cold spring of water when the
people were very thirsty and not let them drink much at first. We
had a very good journey crossing the plains, not much sickness--one
birth and one death. We arrived in Salt lake City on October 1,
1852. On the 13<sup>th</sup> of the following march I was married
to Apostle Wilford Woodruff. </p>

<p>So I was married when next I saw my mother, and she was so
sick and discouraged, she only stayed in Utah one year. Then
there was another sad parting and I have never seen any of my
relatives since.</p>

<p>My elder son David Patton was born April 4, 1854. The next
year I went to Weber and taught school and the following year I
taught in Salt Lake City in the 14<sup>th</sup> ward where I
lived.</p>

<p>After my second son Brigham Y. was born, I learned to make
gloves for the stores. Some were beautifully embroidered with
silk and had long down gauntlets or cuffs. I would get from seven
to fifteen dollars per pair. We made our own cloth. I have washed
wool and carded it for cloth and bedding. We grew and made cloth
from flax and used it for many things, table linens, bed spreads,
and many other things. We made our own carpets from the flax warp.
Now I learned to cut and make dresses. Aunt Phebe Woodruff was a
good tailoress, so we made all our men&#146;s clothes as well as
our own. In 1859 my first daughter Phebe Arabell was born. In
1867 just after my 6<sup>th</sup> child Mary was born I learned
the millenary trade. I made many beautiful hats and bonnets. At
one of our fairs, President Brigham Young came along and looked
at one of my bonnets on exhibition and said, AWhy that is all
Utah&#146;s production except the blue silk lining. I braided the
straw in open work patterns and they were very attractive.
President Young said, AWell if it were in a store and cost $10.00
it would be very fine.</p>

<p>Now another severe trial awaited me. My eldest son was nearly
grown and had a very great love for fine horses which he still
has. He thought he would be so happy to get out on a big stock
ranch where he could raise stock and all the fine horses he
wanted, so his father let him go to the Randolph County, where we
moved May 30, 1871. My husband could not go with me, but his
first wife Phebe, who was a noble woman and a loving mother to us
all when Apostle Woodruff was on Missions which he was much of
the time. She would administer to the sick children and give us
good counsel and advice in all things. I also had to leave my
second son Brigham to finish his education as he was attending
the University.</p>

<p>I taught school one year in Randolph. Then my last child was
born and died in a few days and I came very near following him.
The next year I accompanied Apostle Woodruff on a preaching tour
through Bear Lake Valley. On June 14, 1875, Arabell was married
to Jesse T. Moses. April 1876 my first grandchild was born, Sarah
Eliza Moses. In the fall my daughter moved to Cottonwood, Salt
Lake County and we moved to Smithfield, Cache County. The
following march David married Arabell Hatch. In the spring my son
Brigham graduated from the University and came home to be a
comfort to me, but oh me! We had his sweet company just 24 hours,
he, in company with his brothers, went to the river to shoot
ducks, took off his clothes so as not to get them wet and went in
after the duck. He took a cramp and although he was a good
swimmer, he was brought home to me after being in the river five
days. He was buried June 22. His father was president of the St.
George Temple, so I did not have his company, but although I was
a stranger here the people did all in their power to comfort me.</p>

<p>Now my children began to scatter. David moved to Ashley, Uinta
County, Arabell to Arizona, and my second daughter Sylva to
Liberty, Bear lake. March 6, 1879 Apostle Woodruff left St.
George to begin his pilgrimage in exile among the Saints and
Lamanites in Arizona which lasted several years. During this time
I made hats and dresses to help support myself and my family. In
1882 I had a severe sick spell for several months. In 1884
Arabell made us a visit from Arizona. 1885 my last child Mary
went to Logan A. College leaving me alone. In 1886 Aunt Phebe
Woodruff died. The home in Salt lake City was constantly watched
by the U.S. Marshals and Apostle Woodruff could not go near, but
stood concealed in the Historians office and watched the funeral
procession on its way to the city of the dead. He said, AI hope I
may prove true and faithful to the end and join her in the
Celestial Kingdom of God. In 1887 Arabell moved home from Arizona.
In June, we all went to Bear lake to visit Sylva. The next spring
Mary graduated from the Logan A. College and taught the following
year in Smithfield. April 4, 1889, Apostle Woodruff was sustained
as President of the Church. In the fall I accompanied Mary to
Coalville where she taught school in the Academy. The next year
we went to Farmington where she taught two years in the Academy
there. In 1892 we moved to Provo where she taught in the Academy
nine years.</p>

<p>In 1898 President Woodruff went to California with President
George Q. Cannon who was sick. President Woodruff took suddenly
ill and died September 2, before they could get him home. This
was another severe shock to me. One year later my youngest son
Newton was made Bishop of Smithfield. In two short years dear
Mary on whom I had leaned so heavily for so long was suddenly
taken from me by death. I tried to stay in my home which was so
dear to me and still educate my grandchildren. I had one and two
all the time. I have lived in Provo, but at last my health has
failed me and Newton and Arabell have brought me back to
Smithfield to car for me. I am still thankful for my good
children and prosperity and the light of the Gospel. I am the
mother of eight children. I have 34 grandchildren, and 24 great
grandchildren. </p>

<p>Sister Sarah Woodruff died May 9, 1909 in Smithfield Utah, and
was buried in Salt Lake City, Utah.</p>
