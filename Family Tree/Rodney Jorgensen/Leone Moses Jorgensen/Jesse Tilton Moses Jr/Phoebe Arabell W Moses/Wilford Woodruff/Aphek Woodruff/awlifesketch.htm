		<P class="MsoNormal">Aphek Woodruff; Father of President Wilford Woodruff, was born 
			in Farmington Hartford County, Connecticut November 11, 1775. He was the son of 
			Dinah Woodford and Eldad Woodruff. He had four brothers and two sisters. Eldad, 
			Samuel, Titus, Ozem, Elizabeth and Helen. He married Deulah Thompson November 
			25, 1801 in Farmington. They had three sons, Asmon, Thompson and Wilford. 
			Beulah died January 11, 1808, the baby Wilford was only nine months old. His 
			second marriage was to Azubah Hart who bore him six children, five boys and one 
			girl. He came from a long line of hard working ances¬tors whose lives were 
			distinguished by their sincerity, sobriety and industry. He was a generous 
			hearted man. He rarely refused to grant a favor, even when it seemed probable 
			that the favor might prove a loss to him.</P>
		<P class="MsoNormal">Aphek, by his industry and frugality, had acquired a 
			respectable competency for that time. His property consisted of a large farm 
			well stocked with cattle, a flour mill and a carding machine. These had cost 
			years of toil and self denial. Their loss to him saved him his honor but 
			subjected his family to the hardships which the changed financial conditions 
			brought about. These experiences of Aphek had much to do in the formation of 
			his sons character, for they avoided debts and were scrupulously careful to 
			make their word good in every business undertaking. Aphek became a miller at 
			the age of 18 and followed this occupation for about 50 years. Most of the time 
			he worked 18 hours a day. His son Wilford wrote in his Journal concerning his 
			Father. "he was a man of great charity and integrity, and made himself poor by 
			giving to the poor. He was liberal and accommodating to his fellow men, loaning 
			money and becoming surety for his neighbors. He generally said 'Yes' to anyone 
			who asked a favor at his hands."

		<P class="MsoNormal">On July 1, 1838 Wilford was given a Patriarchal Blessing by 
			the Prophet Joseph Smith. He was told that he would baptize all his Father's 
			household. He knew his Father believed the gospel to be true, but a terrible 
			depression and darkness rested over the whole family that day and Wilford was 
			afraid that he was not going to be able to do what had been promised him in his 
			blessing. He went to his room and prayed fervently to his heavenly Father to 
			remove the evil spirits from the family. After some time he returned to his 
			father's house and they all went to the banks of the

			</st1:place>. There Aphek, his wife Azubah, daughter and several others were 
			baptized. On July 20, 1844 Wilford ordained his father a High Priest and 
			Patriarch.

			</st1:City>
			in 1847. On the way, while trying to get into the wagon he fell to the ground, 
			and the wagon with twenty-five hundred pounds in it, ran over his legs. 
			Miraculously, no bones were broken. His declining years were passed under the 
			loving care of his son Wilford. He lived first in a corner house in the Old 
			Fort, and afterwards resided at the family home which later became known as The 
			Valley House. He died here May 15, 1861 at the age of 83. He lived close to his 
			family and was loved by all who knew him.
