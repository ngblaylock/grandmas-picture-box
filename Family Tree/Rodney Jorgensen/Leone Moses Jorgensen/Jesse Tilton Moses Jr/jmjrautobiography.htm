<p>I was borne in a one room log house on the 28th day of January
1878. This was about 14 by 16 feet in size and stood on the banks
of Big Cottonwood creek on my grandfather's (James Moses) estate.
It was here I spent the first three years of my life while an
infant, I was stricken with pneumonia. Mother, in her anxiety for
my life, called upon her father Wilford Woodruff, who was then an
apostle, to come and give me a blessing. He promised Mother that
I should live to the allotted age of man; well I have just
celebrated my birthday 80th, and am in excellent health, with a
good strong constitution. In the fall of 1880, Father, with, some
other families, was called to go to Mesa, Arizona, and help
settle up that country. Accordingly, in November, he and Harvy
Harper loaded their wagons and set out on a trip of over six
hundred miles, arriving at their destination in about three weeks.
I was too young to remember much of the trip, but I remember
faintly of ferrying across the Colorado river at Lees Ferry. The
opposite bank was steep and as it had been raining, the roads
were muddy, Mother decided she would rather walk than ride up
that hill so she took Sylva in her arms and me by her side and
trudged up that long muddy hill. On arriving at the Salt River,
Harvy Harper settled at Jonesville and father put up a temporary
shack on the Tempee canal, about four miles from the town of Mesa.
Jonesville has since been changed to Lehi. This shack was on the
homestead father had taken up. We stayed there for two years then
father acquired 80 acres adjacent to the town of Mesa. He put up
an adobe house with a willow shed by the side of it for a shade.
He planted a vineyard and set out a number of fruit trees. As the
climate here was warm the year around, vegetation grew rapidly
and rank. Father son had a good farm established while living
there I would go at times to some of the neighbors to play with
children of my own age. On one of these occasions while coming
home, I picked up in the road a new carpenter&#146;s saw. A swarm
of bees was settling on a bush by the side of the road. I struck
the swarm with the broad side of the saw. I dropped the saw and
didn&#146;t loose any time getting away from there. I had at
least 8 or 10 stings on my head and face. I wasn&#146;t very far
from home but by the time I got there my eyes were swollen shut
and I was otherwise suffering considerably. I didn&#146;t bring
the saw home with me but I think father went back and got it.
While living on the bank of the Tampee canal, father taught me to
swim. He would take me on his back and swim across the canal;
when he would get almost across he would shake me off and make me
paddle to shore. By the time I was four I could swim across
myself. We stayed at mesa for eight years. When mother&#146;s
health got so bad she could not endure the heat any longer so we
moved back to Utah. While at mesa I was baptized in the canal
that run close to our house on my eight birthday, by either Henry
or William Rogers.</p>

<p>When we moved back to Utah, father farmed grandfather Moses&#146;
place for one year, then moved to Smithfield, Cache Valley. There
with a number of others he engaged in the mercantile business.
While thus engaged he also purchased a farm. </p>

<p>I had two or three short terms in school at Mesa, then went to
school for three years at Smithfield. At the age of fifteen I
went to Cottonwood and lived with aunt Martha and Uncle Fred.
While there I went to the seminary at Millcreek, taught by Horace
Cummings and Samuel Cornwall. The next two years I spent at the
Brigham Young Academy at Provo. While there I had my Patriarchal
blessing by patriarch Charles D. Evans. In that blessing he
promised me that I should live long upon the earth, verifying my
grandfather Woodruff&#146;s promise to me while an infant. After
two years there I stayed home a year and helped father on the
farm. The winter I was twenty, I was called on a mission to the
Northern States. Chicago was headquarters for that mission. From
there I was assigned to labor in Missouri. I kept a daily journal
while in the mission field. Suffice it to say, I had many
wonderful experiences while in that field of labor. I arrived
home from my mission in Aug of 1900 and went into the harvest
field and worked for six weeks pitching grain, then went into the
canyon and got out our winter wood. This brought on an attack of
chills and fever from witch I suffered for more than two months.
After recovering from this I took a trip to Cottonwood. While
there, I got a job fencing railroad right of way. This lasted for
several weeks. This gave me an opportunity to renew my friendship
with an old sweetheart, Miss Lavina Harper. After the fencing job
I decided to try selling books. During the latter part of the
summer, my brother Wilford and I drifted into the Vernal country.
I was still selling books but that fall my brother and I were
offered a job teaching school. We both accepted and stayed there
for the winter, After school was out I went back home and helped
father on the farm during the summer. On the 23rd of September
that year I married Lavina Harper, This was in 1903. I did odd
jobs from then until 1907 when we moved to Smithfield. I acquired
three acres of ground from my father then went to work in the
brick yard at one dollar per day and bought the brick to put up a
home. My brother Dave and I went into the canyon and logged all
winter, We got lumber out for a big barn for father. For the use
of his outfits in this way I acquired enough lumber to put me up
some sheds and finish my home which I did during the summer and
fall of 1908. At Christmas time this year I was offered a school
at Randolph. I accepted the position and came home in the spring
with a team and buggy. During that summer Lavina and I took a
trip by team to Salt Lake to pay a visit to her folks. We planted
part of our lot to strawberries and did real well with them. We
were ever mindful of our tithing and other church affiliations.
Also, while living at Smithfield, we would spend a few days each
year in the Logan temple. In the year 1912 I went to Nevada and
took up a homestead near Metropolis about all this ever amounted
to was a lot of hard work. During the summertime my brother in
law, Benjamin Handley and my brother Dave and would take
contracts putting up hay on some of the big ranches in Star
Valley. It was while in Star Valley on the A. T. Rose ranch that
Charles was borne in 27 Oct 1916. In the summer of 1917 we moved
back to Metropolis. I built a house on the townsight of
Metropolis. It was there that Erma was born the last of Nov and
died just before Christmas. She was buried in the Metropolis
cemetery. I was janitor of the Metropolis ward chapel that winter.
In the spring Mr. Rose came after me to take care of his ranch
that summer of 1917. I stayed and fed cattle for him the
following winter. During the winter of 1917 at the Rose ranch we
had a siege of scarlet fever with five of the children down at
the same time, but with careful nursing and the power of the
priesthood they all recovered nicely though some of them were
very sick. Our neighbors were all outsiders and not very
accommodating for never once did any of them offer to do a turn
for us. When the spring of 1918 came we left Nevada to come to
Idaho and settle in the big Lost River Valley and became member
of the Arco ward. When we left Nevada we all left on the train.
Lavina and the children stayed in Salt lake while her brother
William and I chartered a car and loaded it with machinery, live
stock, and furniture and went on to Lost River. </p>

<p>After getting unloaded I went back to Nevada and got my outfit
consisting of four head of horses, a wagon, a buggy, some
machinery, a stove, and a few other things. I spent 11 days
driving from Death to Lost River, with a four-horse outfit and
was glad when the end of the journey came. We had purchased the
farm of 80 acres. I, taking the North half and William the South.
We were all glad to get settled in our own home, Lavina and the
children arrived before I got back with the outfit. I went to
work immediately and put in my crop. I did real well that summer.
Just a few days after I arrived our daughter Fern was born. Uncle
Chester Harper 1oaned us a cow for the summer. I bought her from
him in the fall. She proved to be a very good one as she
furnished what milk and butter we needed for nine of us. There
was 10 acres of hay on the place and I planted 10 acres more that
spring.</p>

<p>The year 1918 was very eventful. World War I was raging and
men up to the age of 40 were being drafted into service. Land
values were soaring; the spirit of speculation was running high.
People were mortgaging their homes and farms to buy more land,
and within two or three years lost everything they had. </p>

<p>In the year 1919, the Lost River Stake was organized by
Apostle Melvin J. Ballard. I was ordained a High Priest and set
apart as one of the high council by Apostle Ballard. Several new
wards in the valley were organized; among them was the Lost River
ward--there we then resided.</p>

<p>In 1923 some of the family were ready for high school and as
high school facilities were not very good we decided to move to
Blackfoot for the winter. During the winter I worked for the
sugar, company in the factory at Blackfoot. During the winter I
came down with an attack of bronchial pneumonia which kept me out
of work for two weeks. In the spring, instead of going back to
Lost River, I rented a farm near Blackfoot and leased my place in
Lost River. Early that fall I bought some leaner pigs and fed
them corn and barley all winter--then sold them in the spring far
the same price that I bought them for--not a profitable
experience. The next three years we farmed 120 acres of the sugar
company lease on the Fort Hall Indian Reservation. We had to move
into Blackfoot during the winter for school facilities. During
the three ye4ars we were on the reservation, I built up a nice
heard of young cows. With them was a young Jersey bull and as I
was going out to milk one evening, I just passed him by when he
made a dive at me and knocked me down. As he jumped over me he
hit my face with one foot which caused me a lot o pain. During
the time we were farming on the reservation we belonged to the
First ward in Blackfoot. During this time I taught a Sunday class
of boys, and also taught the Melchizedek Priesthood group. As the
first ward chapel had burned down while Brother Royal M. Jeppeson
was bishop. A new chapel had to be built. I was chosen as one of
the committee of five to raise the funds for the building. We had
$20,000 collected in just a short time and the building was
started immediately and was completed in a few months at a cost
of $50,000. This was in 1926.</p>

<p>The following year the Sugar company lease was up on the
reservation so that necessitated another move. I procured a lease
on a 600 acre ranch belonging to the New York Life Insurance Co.,
mostly sage brush and river bottom. Only 90 acres of irrigated
land. This was in the Pingre Ward. We did very well here as I had
nearly 20 head of young milk cows. While here I was chosen second
counselor to Bishop Buchanan. I had a three year lease on this
ranch and when that was up another agent came out from the
company and he asked $500 cash beside the crop rent. This I
turned down and moved to Sterling and rented a place of Frank
Herbert. The grasshoppers came this year and almost annihilated
our crops and the country was in the midst of a financial
depression. So we were once more reduced to a starting point. I
heard of a place West of Blackfoot which was in charge of a
mister Collins, an attorney in Pocatello. I started out on foot
with four dollars in my pocket for Pocatello, a distance of sixty
miles, to see Mr. Collins. I found him and signed a five year
lease. So we had another move, this time to Riverside. This place
was on the Snake River, covered with brush, cottonwood trees and
gravel. There was about 35 acres of good soil which we planted to
beans, oats, barley, and corn. And seeded with the grain a few
acres of hay. We had four horses, six or seven heads of cows and
heifers, a good wagon, machinery, and furniture. Charles, a lad
of 16 did the moving with the help of a neighbor boy. He did most
of the cropping this spring as I had other things to look after.
During our wanderings we never lost track of our devotion to God
and our duties in the church. We took turns in family prayer. One
morning while engaged in prayer, something happened that started
the family laughing. Instead of calling them down as they
expected to be, I said with a smile, &quot;I think the Lord
enjoys a good laugh once in a while.&quot;</p>

<p>I will devote this page to some of the dreams I have had and
the impressions they have had on me. While in Nevada, I worked
part of a summer irrigating for Brother Milton Woolf. He had a
large field of wheat I was irrigating. I was out in the field one
night until eleven o&#146;clock. I did not go home at night as it
was at least six miles. I slept and cooked in a small shack in
the field. I came in and retired for the night. I hadn&#146;t
been asleep very long when Lavina, my wife, came to me and put
her arm around me and said, &quot;Jesse, I am tired of being
poor, Lets go over to Brother ? and get a blessing.&quot; So
accordingly we went. When we arrived at the place it was the
tithing office, a nice brick building. On the North side was a
narrow board walk beside which ran a crystal clear stream of
water. We entered the building and there sat a man of about 60.
His hair was greying, his beard was short and inclined to be
slightly curly, his eyes were grey with a tender look in them. He
was stocky build in height, about 5ft. 8 inches tall. He saluted
us and asked what he could do for us. I told him we had come for
a blessing. He asked us to be seated. He sent a clerk in the
basement to bring up a large box of produce. The clerk presently
came back with two boxes; one filled with large rolls of butter
staked high, the other one had other things in, such as eatables.
He pointed to the boxes and said, &quot;Jesse, here is your
tithing, you may have it.&quot; I said &quot;No, I have given
that to the Lord. We want a blessing.&quot; With a beautiful
smile on his face, one that I shall never forget, he said, &quot;Jesse,
the Lord will have a tried people. They will be tried as gold,
seven times in the furnace. But when your trials are over, the
Lord will remember you as he did his servant Job, with all that
your heart desires. At this time I felt very thirsty and said I
think I will have a drink. I went outside and by the corner of
the building was a large tree. In the forks was a bright new tin
cup. I took the cup and dipped water from this little stream and
drank. Never had I tasted anything so refreshing. It truly was
water from the spring of Paradise. I went back in the house and
asked Lavina if she was ready to go. We bid our brother goodbye
and left. Truly a messenger from the other world had visited me
in my dream.</p>

<p>Another dream I find very much impressed upon my mind. I was
walking up a small pebbly bottomed creek with just a trickle of
water in it. I would occasionally pick up a small trout and once
in a while two. After traveling for some distance I was
confronted by a large monster. I could not get out of the creek
to get around the monster as he had long tentacles. It started
toward me and I had to keep backing up to get out of its way. It
finally had me backed up against a great wall that I could
neither climb over not get around. It looked as though I was
going to be devoured. I looked up for some source of help. As I
did so, I saw a sword of most exquisite beauty, quality, and
workmanship. It hung within easy reach, so I grasped it by the
hilt and with a few well directed strokes had the monster cut
down. On cutting it open I beheld a large beautiful trout. In
these two I see represented the waters of life and the sword of
truth. Like my grandfather Woodruff, I love to fish. I often
dream of fishing in a clear stream of water and catching trout.</p>

<p>While living on the Thorson place, which was two miles West
and a mile South of the Snake River bridge, I purchased a place
adjacent to the town of Riverside. This was in 1935; I paid $250
as a down payment on the place with a $2500 contract, with a
payment of $500 per year. With the help of my son Charles, we
operated the two places. There was no buildings on the place of
40 acres we had just purchased so we built a basement house which
we lived in for a number of years. We were contemplating building
a log house so Charles and I went up into Warm River and worked
in the timber for several weeks and got out a nice lot of logs,
but instead of putting them into the house we built a chicken
coop and cow barn with them. On the place had been a ten acre
apple orchard. The trees were old and were not a good variety so
the second spring we were there I decided to take them out. So
Charles helped and a small team of horses we pulled 130 in a week.
I then trimmed them, burned the brush, and sold the wood to the
packing plant to smoke meat with. I did all my farming with
horses as most people were doing up to this time. I planted a few
acres of beets, some beans, potatoes, and grain. Also kept enough
hay planted to feed my stock through the winter. I made a
practice of buying a few head of dairy heifers in the early fall
and feeding them through the winter and selling them in the
spring for summering them on the range. This I found quite
lucrative. </p>

<p>While living in Idaho, Lavina and I made many trips to the
Logan temple. We were at the head of the genealogy work of the
Riverside ward. I was also High Priest Group Leader, was teacher
of the Gospel Doctrine class in Sunday School. In 1945 Lavina and
I attended the dedication of the Idaho Falls temple. From then on
I did considerable endowment work in that temple. From this time
on my wife&#146;s health was such that she was not able to
participate in this work with me. I often took a load in my car
to the temple with me. In connection with other duties, I spent
both time and money in preparing the records of my ancestors and
in doing the endowment and sealing work for them. In the year
1847, I sold the property in Big Lost River, bought another 80
acres deeded it to Everett and Leone, and took a mortgage on it.
With the balance of the money I finished building my home in
Riverside. At this time the Riverside ward was contemplating
building a new ward chapel. I was chosen a member of the finance
committee which consisted of five members. As material and labor
was quite reasonable at this time, the building was estimated at
$38,000. Within a very short time we had $20,000 raised with
which to commence the work. The next year prices began to soar,
but at a little over three years we had the building completed at
a cost of $75,000, which was a credit to the ward population. At
this time I might say that when we first moved to Blackfoot, we
were members of the first ward. Their chapel had just burned down
so we were under the necessity of renting a place in which to
meet. In 1924 a new meeting house was proposed by Bishop W. E.
Bills. I was chosen as a member of the finance committee for this
one. I have been active in various ward activities everywhere I
have lived, besides never losing interest in my responsibility to
my ancestors. On the 28<sup>th</sup> day of last January 1958, I
was 80 years old. My sister Sylva and I have spent the past two
winters in the St. George temple, which we have enjoyed very much.
Our health has been good, the climate has been delightful and our
experiences have been rich and gratifying. </p>

<p>On the 29<sup>th</sup> of March 1958, my daughter Lavina came
to St. George to take us to her place in Antimony. She had a new
Oldsmobile and we packed it to capacity. We had our bedding,
clothes, some fruit, vegetables, dishes, cooking wear, and three
traveling cases each, besides some boxes. Lavina is a good
driver, so we arrived at her home in good time and in good
spirits. The next day was Sunday and proclaimed fast day on
account of general conference being on the next Sunday&#150;so we
all went to church. We had priesthood meeting, Sunday School, and
fast meeting between 8:45 and 1:00. We then went home, had a good
dinner and that evening went to mutual program which was very
entertaining. The following week Gus was plowing between flurries.
I made a trip to Richfield with Lavina and one with Gus for
machinery repairs and groceries. We spent some of the evening
playing Rook, Chinese checkers, and just visiting. The following
Sunday was general conference, but owing to the lack of
television in that locality, the Bishop decided to hold meeting&#150;so
we all went to meeting. Monday morning we packed up our things,
that is what we would need during the summer, leaving the rest at
Lavina&#146;s. Lavina took us to Salt Lake City. Sylva stayed in
Salt lake, I went back as far as Provo with her. At Provo I have
two grandsons and a grand daughter going to school at the BYU.
They are all married. Norman has two sons, Ronald and Joyce&#150;one
each. I stayed in Provo a couple of days where I received a
hearty welcome from members of the family. We all got together at
Joyce&#146;s for an evening of dinner and spent an enjoyable
evening. Harper&#146;s son-in-law Stanley Hunt, was passing
through on his way to Moab&#150;so instead of staying over night
at Provo, we decided to go n to Moab that night. I had planned to
go to Moab to see two of my grandchildren and their families. At
1:00 on the morning of the 10<sup>th</sup> of April, Stanley and
I arrived at Moab. The next day Harpers Wilford and his son-in-law
Gary Ellibee arrived at Moab. The next day, the 13<sup>th</sup>
being Sunday, we all went to priesthood meeting and Sunday School.
After Sunday School we fixed up a nice picnic and went out to the
Arches National Monument, five miles North of Moab. This area is
a wonderland of natures carvings in the red sandstone. We spent a
most pleasant afternoon eating lunch in the shade of a large
Juniper. We spent a couple of horse trailing around in the coves
and on the cliffs. I stayed in Moab until the 16<sup>th</sup>. I
came as far as Blackfoot with Wayne and Garry, who were on their
way to Parma. While on our way we stopped in Provo to pick up my
baggage. There, I had some also in Salt Lake. While in Salt Lake
I called Sylvia up and found she was laid up with three broken
ribs. She was staying with her granddaughter Margey Angel. Well,
we resumed our journey, arriving in Blackfoot at 2:00AM on the 17<sup>th</sup>.
I spent most of the next day in the temple at Idaho Falls. I also
cleaned up the raspberry patch for Mary.</p>
