<p>September 16, 1898 was a happy occasion for Thomas William and
Elizabeth Martha Biggs Durrant because their first son, William
Earl, was born. This little son who brought so much joy to those
parents, was to grow up and influence many lives, five who were
privileged to be his children.</p>

<p>He had eight brothers and sisters, Loon A. Jan. 21, 1902,
Inez, 27 April 1904, Died 24 March 1905. Thomas Henry Nov. 24,
1905 Edna Agnes, Jan. 9, 1909, Sarah Oct. 1, 1911, Orvill Dean,
April 6, 19129 Inc Elvira, Dec. 4, 1915 and Elizabeth Sept. 23,
1919.</p>

<p>He was an active boy as he grow up, taking an interest in the
things his father did, sometimes to his delight, other times
inciting his anger, such as when as a small boy, Earl painted a
wagon with his dad&#146;s entire supply of wagon grease. To his
dismay, his efforts were not properly appreciated by his father.</p>

<p>At about age five, his family moved from Franklin to
Blackfoot, Idaho. He started school at Blackfoot and only went a
few months, when to his delight, the school house burned down and
his education had to be discontinued, to be started again when
they moved back to Franklin the next year. He progressed well in
all areas of school, especially mathematics.</p>

<p>He had a deep feeling of love for his parents and brothers and
sisters and was kind and thoughtful to them; of course, he was a
boy and was also full of mischief and teasing. On one occasion
when he was about 12 years old, he was staying with his
Grandmother Biggs, and Aunt May had planned a party for Halloween.
She had her friends gathered around the dining ream table telling
spooky stories to each other in the dim light. Earl and May&#146;s
younger brother Bill Biggs had been banished from the part of the
house she was using for the evening, and threatened with an awful
doom if they so much as showed up or made a sound during the
party. There was a small hole in the ceiling, where a chimney had
been taken out, which had been temporarily covered from the attic
floor. By removing the cover, the boys were able to listen to
what was going on, until they became bored and decided to look
around for some way to entertain themselves. In a corner of the
attic, there was an old trunk, and they found an old white
flannel nightgown in it, and to aunt May&#146;s consternation,
right in the middle of one of the scariest stories, a shrieking,
headless ghost came fluttering down from above and landed in the
middle of the table, scattering startled boys and screaming girls
all over the room. As you might imagine, even Aunt May&#146;s
wrath could not dim the boy&#146;s glee, they howled with
laughter.</p>

<p>Earl was very athletic an excellent ice skater and talented
baseball player, he kept busy with school, work on the farm and
care of, the farm animals, and playing baseball every chance he
had.</p>

<p>He developed into a key player, mainly as catcher, on the
Franklin teem and progressed to the point where he was accepted
to go to the West Coast and play on one of the Minor League teams.
At this time, when hopes and plans for the future were being
formed in this vein, he had an accident which changed the whole
course of his life. At about 18 yrs. of age, while riding
horseback along the shoulder of the road, a car struck the horse,
knocking it down on Earl, leaving him with a leg that never
regained its former strength and agility.</p>

<p>The great flu epidemic swept through Franklin during the
winter and spring of 1918 and 1919. He had his sickness early in
the siege and then he and a friend who also had it went from
house to house helping those many families who wore stricken with
the flu, many times entire households would be down at once.</p>

<p>During the winter of 1921 , when Earl was 23, his brother Leon
and his girlfriend, Mary Moses from Smithfield, Utah invited Earl
to a party at her house. At this party Earl met the girl he would
later make his wife, Mary H Moses, the neice of Mary, staying
with her grandparents and attending North Cache High School. They
formed a friendship which continued to grow for two years, and in
the spring of 1924 they wore planing a wedding for August. Mary
was back home in Blackfoot and a letter she received from Earl in
July, changed all this because he was writing to tell her he had
been called to the Western States Mission so they postponed their
wedding. He served well for two years in the mission field. Mary
and Earl kept in touch through letters, and when he returned they
continued their plans and set another wedding date. On the 30th
of March 1927 they were married in the Salt Lake Temple and
started married life with $30.00 borrowed money, but with their
love for each other and hopes and plans for the future, they were
truly rich.</p>

<p>For a few weeks they lived with Earl's parents while they were
getting their crops in and readying the house that was located on
the farm--just across the state line in Utah, 1 1/2 miles south
of his fathers home in Franklin.</p>

<p>Earl and his Dad and Orville ran the&#146; farm together. He
and his wife belonged to the Franklin Ward whore Earl taught a
Genealogy class, a Sunday School class, and attended the Temple
often.</p>

<p>February 21, 1923, their first son, Norman William, was born.
He was by nature a very devoted son, kind and considerate of his
brothers and sisters, and always willing to do the things his
parents asked him. He took outstanding honors in music during his
high school and collage years.</p>

<p>The second son was born 2 1/2 years later, August 7, 1930.
Ronald Jesse was a lively cheerful child with a tremendous sense
of humor that provided entertainment for the whole family. He was
also a top scholar and a fine baseball player in the tradition of
his father.</p>

<p>One early spring day, March 9, 1933, the third son, Wilford
Charles, came on the scene. He was his father's constant
companion in the fields and at home, unless it was necessary for
him to be left home, then his mother would have a time consoling
him. Wilford also excelled in sports, lettering<sub> </sub>in
basketball, baseball and football in high school, and was in most
of the high school plays as one of the leading men.</p>

<p>December 16, 1935 a beautiful baby girl was born. She was the
pride and joy of her parents and brothers, and has continued to
be throughout her life. Lois Joyce developed a keen sense of
humor, perhaps due to the competition she felt with her three
older brothers. She was very adept at story telling and had the
opportunity of taking part on many programs in church and school
in this capacity.</p>

<p>July 3, 1930, a fourth son, Garold Earl, joined the family
circle and again there was rejoicing in the home. Garold also
wanted to be with his dad continually. He loved the outdoors, and
sports and loved to drive anything on wheels. He had a very kind
and sympathetic nature, and kept the family well supplied with
abandoned puppies because he felt sorry for them.</p>

<p>August 26, 1944, a second daughter, Mary Jane was born. The
supreme joy of this event was short, as she was taken away three
days after her birth. This brought great sorrow to the family,
but comfort came in the knowledge that they would, if faithful,
be with her again, As the years passed, and the children grew,
Earl worked hard farming the forty acres he bought from his dad,
which included the house and buildings. The three of them
continued to work together and as the boys grew older they helped
with the work. Also, Thomas&#146; boys, Loa, Dan, and Blaine
worked in the beets and hay along with them.</p>

<p>As the children grew, they were taught the principles of the
gospel by the steady example of parents who worked in the church
and regularly took the whole family to all of the meetings. Each
child in turn was baptized and confirmed by their father. Earl
and Mary were also kept very busy helping the children write and
learn talks for church, Sunday school, Primary M.I.A. and
attending school, P.T.A. programs, school plays, athletic events,
and music events that the different children were participating
in. The family had moved their membership from Franklin to Cove
Ward, and here they continued to be active.</p>

<p>On October 2, 1941, Earl&#146;s beloved mother died suddenly,
and this was a real loss to him and his family. They really
missed the visits with a loving mother and grandmother.</p>

<p>Norman and Ronald graduated from North Cache High School, and
in the spring of 1949, the family moved from the farm south of
Franklin to a farm 5 miles west of Blackfoot, Idaho in Riverside,
Idaho. Here the younger children finished school and graduated
from Snake River High School, Moreland, Idaho.</p>

<p>Norman married a Riverside girl, Edna Polatis, in the Logan
Temple, August 25, 1950, then served two years active duty in the
armed services, after which he and Edna moved back to Riverside
and filled a two year Stake Mission.</p>

<p>After serving his two year hitch in the army, Ronald left from
Riverside Ward to fill a mission in Western Canada. He and Norman
got home about the same time and enrolled at Brigham Young
University.</p>

<p>Wilford and Joyce graduated from high school in 1952 and 1954
and both went to Ricks College in Rexburg then worked in
Blackfoot. Joyce married John H. Stood in the Idaho Falls Temple
on March 29, 1956 and John attended B.Y.U. along with Norman and
Ran. Ronald married Annie May Olnoy from Los Angeles in the Los
Angeles Temple July 20, 1956.</p>

<p>Wilford served his two years in the army, then went to Dixie
College in St. George for two years, and to Utah State University
where he received his B.S. Degree. He married Carol Kay April 16,
1965; solemnized in the Manti Temple</p>

<p>Garold served two years in the army, then married Gloria Raa
Warren on December 2, 1960.</p>

<p>Earl and Mary wore very proud of their children&#146;s
achievements, and helped and encouraged them in all the things
they tried to do.</p>

<p>Earl continued to run the farm in Riverside they had bought
from Mary&#146;s father, and he was active in church positions
and coached the Ward&#146;s Sr. softball team for several years.
Wilford and both played for him.</p>

<p>About 1964, he began to suffer from a defective heart and had
to slow down. They sold the farmland, keeping 10 acres and the
house and buildings, and he had to learn to take it rather easy.
He enjoyed his children immensely and delighted in each of the
grandchildren and they all know of his love for them, as surely
as his own five children had known it, and they all loved him
dearly. He was mourned by twenty-one grandchildren; his companion
of forty years and their five living children. When after a three
year illness, the last five weeks of which he spent in the
Gingham Memorial Hospital, he died on April 10, 1967, just one
and one-half years after his own father died, December 1, 1965.</p>

<p>William Earl Durrant is remembered by all who knew him as a
thoughtful son and brother, a loving husband, a devoted father
and Grandfather, and a treasured friend.</p>
