<p>Jesse Tilton, in the name of Jesus Christ and by virture of
the Holy Priesthood, I lay my hands upon your head and seal upon
thee a blessing as the Lord shall direct. Thy lineage decent
comes from the family of Abishom, and life is held with Christ in
God. Thou shalt go forth as a messenger of salvation and declare
good tidings in distant lands. Thy mind shall expand as the
flowers of the field under the golden sun beam. The doctrines of
Christ shall spring up before thee as a new creation from the
hands of its maker. Thou shalt be established in the truth and be
a father in Israel. The seal of the Lord and the Holy anointing
shall be upon thee if thou wilt harken to the voice of the Spirit.
And thy light shall continue to increase, and thou shalt be able
to expound the scriptures and so make clear the doctrines of the
Church; and thou shalt not be confounded in argument. Therefore,
study the written word, store thy mind with knowledge, apply thy
heart to wisdom, and all shall be well with thee. Thou shalt live
long and thine inheritance be sure. Thy family shall honor thee.
Thou shalt live to see the sun in darkness and the moon as blood,
and the earth tremble beneath the power of God, the Lord. Thy
brethren shall listen to thy words with delight and thy counsels
shall be laid in safety. Thou shalt see Zion in her glory, her
towers glitter and the power of her enemies removed. The Jews
restored to their former glory. And all shall be well with thy
house and the angel of peace shall dwell within it. The spirit of
prophecy shall be with thee for thou shalt know the future and
thy name shall remain on earth and be written for thy generations
after thee. And I seal thee up unto Eternal Lives and to thrones
and dominions in the name of Jesus Christ Amen.</p>
