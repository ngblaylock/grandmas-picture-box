<p>James Moses born Feb. 28 1806; was the son of Jesse Moses and
Ester Brown, whose family consisted of nine children: Giles, b.
Apr. 26, 1789; Achsa, b. Dec. 9, 1797; Roxylana, b. Apr. 22, 1804;
James, the subject of this sketch; Julian, b. Apr. 11, 1810;
Fidelia. b. Jan. 13, 1810; Annie; Phebe; Parnell, I haven't been
able to obtain the birth date of the last three girls. </p>

<p>According to the Terry history James Moses married Apr. 9,
1833 Roxy Mariah Terry of Norfolk, Conn. They joined the Mormons
and moved to Caanan Conn. two children were born to them in
Caanan; Jane Mariah b. Apr. 20, 1835; John b. Oct. 2, 1837; D.
Feb. 29, 1840; John was born in Kirtland Ohio I have found out
later. He also died there. Roxy died shortly after John was born...
After his wife, Roxy's death James moved to Nauvoo and married in
Nauvoo, about 1839, Eliza Spencer; Their family consisted of the
following sons and daughters; John Moroni, b. July 12, 1840; d.
Oct. 23, 1840; Martha Ester, b. Oct. 15, 1844; These two were
born in Nauvoo. </p>

<p>The persecutions become so severe in Nauvoo at this time, the
saints were forced to leave the beautiful city, James Moses moved
into Council Bluffs Iowa. Three children were born to them in
this place; my father Jesse Tilton b. May 9, 1848; Eliza Ann (Newman)
b. Aug. 9, 1850; James Spencer, b, Feb. 14, 1853. It was
grandfather's intention to move West with the saints prior to
this time. But owing to the misfortune of loosing one yoke of
oxen and having another stolen by the indians--was left without
outfits to move on. This, however, proved fortunate for at this
time he received word from his father to come back home and take
care of he and his mother until they died then settle up the
estate. He asked President Young's advice on the matter and was
told &quot;by all means go back and take care of your folks.&quot;
Grandfather had a little money, about $800 which he loaned to the
immigration fund and started his long trek of 1500 miles back to
Caanan Conn. Uncle Fred, as he was afterwards affectionately
called, was born in Caanan June 5, 1856; his name, Fredrick
Fillmore Moses. </p>

<p>James Moses and his family sojourned in Caanan until 1861 when
they immigrated to Utah. He took care of his fathers estate which
consisted of a lumber mill, a grist mill, a grove of maple trees,
a farm, some grazing land, and a small dairy, also some chickens.
They sold eggs, butter, and cheese, in the spring they made quite
a quantity of maple sugar; I have in my possession an eight
gallon brass kettle which they used to boil down their maple
syrup. I also have a hickory walking stick that has been in the
Moses family for four generations. </p>

<p>Aunt Martha as well as my father used to tell of their walking
to school a distance of two miles except when the weather was bad
then the folks would take them in their carriage. Some time in
the winter the snow would get so deep it would cover the fences
and it was no trouble to drive over them in their sleigh. </p>

<p>When grandfather arrived in Utah in 1861 he purchased from a
Mr. Gibson--a tract of land in the neighborhood of 80 acres
located on Big Cotton creek. There were a number of cottonwood
groves on the place. I well remember grandfather, as I was 13
years old when he passed away. During the time when I was from 11
to 13 we stayed at grandfathers quite a lot. When he came to Utah
he brought with him a few head of cows, some oxen, and some good
horses. He always raised a good garden. I was out with him one
day while he was hoeing in the garden. I noticed he would walk
from the bottom of the row to the top to start hoeing each time.
I asked him &quot;Why do you do that?&quot; Well, he said, &quot;
the ground is so level, I have to keep pulling the dirt toward
the ditch so the water will run through.&quot; He also raised a
patch of pumpkins for his cows, he had a vegetable cellar in the
side of a hill some distance from the house where he kept his
vegetables and apples. He had a nice apple orchard. I used to go
up to the cellar with him and help him cut up his pumpkins for
his cows. Then he would tell me stories. </p>

<p>One story he told about his father. His father kept a negro
servant; One day he wanted a pole to put in his corral. He called
Mose, as he called his negro servant, I want you to go out and
get me a pole and Mose, I want a straight one. Mose accordingly
went and brought in the pole and reported; &quot;Masa I got the
pole.&quot; &quot;Well Mose, was it straight.&quot; &quot;Yes
Masa, fact Masa, it was so straight it leaned back a little.&quot;
</p>

<p>I am indebted to my father for this one. &quot;Uncle Julian
bought a mowing machine for outing hay, it was of course horse
drawn, and one of the first to come into Utah. Uncle Julian told
father that if he would come up, he lived at East Mill Creek, and
help him put up his hay he could take the machine to cut his own
hay. So father went up and helped uncle Julians indian boy Ike
put up his hay; then took the machine down home, they lived about
four miles apart, when father drove into the yard grandfather
looked at the outfit and said &quot;take that thing off--wont
have it on the place.&quot; Father went down to the field and
started cutting hay. Grandfather came down with a scythe on his
shoulder. By the time he got there father had gone a round or
two, (grandfather was quite an adept at swinging a scythe), but
after watching the mower for a minute or two he put the scythe on
his shoulder and went to the house. He raised mostly meadow hay.
He put what he could in the barn. The best--that he wanted to
feed his milk cows. The wild hay, he stacked close to the corral
for his young stock. His stacks weren't very large as they had to
pitch the hay off the wagon by hand. And in the wintertime,
instead of taking the top off the stack, he had a long stick
forked at one end, which he would shove into the stack and pull
the hay out with it. He thought that was most economical. He
would bring his pumpkins that he had cut up down from the cellar
in a wheel borrow for his cows. He would feed his horses and cows
a few carrots and took a great deal of pride in having his stock
look good. In the fall, when the apples were ripe, he would feed
his cows a few. He had one tree that bore a large quantity of
small golden sweet apples he liked for his cows. He didn't get
all of them for his cows, for we children thought there was no
apple quite so good as those golden sweets. </p>

<p>While residing in Nauvoo James Moses became very intimately
acquainted with the prophet Joseph Smith. On one occasion when
the mob was searching for the prophet he slipped over to the
Moses home unbeknown to any one and had a good night's rest
without fear of being molested because the mob wouldn't be
looking for him there. In the morning grandma Moses fixed a good
breakfast for him and took it in his room on a tray. The tray is
treasured in the family yet. Grandfather used to visit the
prophet at his home. On one of these errands just as he was
leaving the prophet asked him if he had a book of Mormon.
Grandfather said he didn't have one. So the prophet autographed
one of the first that came from the press and gave to him. This
book is now in my own family. </p>

<p>After coming to Utah grandfather had many visits from the
church authorities especially when the U. S. Marshals were
hunting for them. Grandfather's place had a number of cottonwood
groves and in some of the groves was plenty of underbrush making
good places of concealment; also a splendid breeding place for
the brush rabbit and quail. Some of his friends liked to come out
in the wintertime for a little quail hunting. </p>

<p>President Woodruff would sometimes go out to the Moses farm
while hiding from the Marshals. While grandfather Woodruff was on
the place grandfather Moses was very cautious not to make his
identity known, he wouldn't let his neighbors know of his being
there. On one occasion, Wilford was there and wanted something to
do. So James set him to pruning his orchard. While up in the tree
a neighbor drove into the yard and seeing this man up in the tree
asked James who he had treed up there, to which James replied,
&quot;O, just an old codger that wanted a job for a day or two.&quot;
</p>

<p>James Moses was a man of slender build about five foot seven
inches tall and weighed about 130 pounds he stood erect walked
straight and was light on his feet. He was very supple at the age
of 60 he could grip a straight stick in his bands and jump over
it forward and backward a number of times. </p>

<p>James Moses' home on Big cottonwood creek was a story and a
half--adobe structure--the attic being large enough for two bed
rooms and a storage room. The ground floor has on the West side,
a pantry and a bedroom, in the center of the building was a large
dining room and on the east side of this room was a large
fireplace and a stairway leading to the attic. On the east part
of the house was a loving room, a bedroom, and a storeroom. </p>

<p>The fireplace was large enough to hold an ample supply of wood
over the fireplace was a large mantle, which held a number of
heirlooms and grandfather's eight-day clock. On the north side of
the fireplace and next to the stairway was grandfather's favorite
chair where he would spend the long winter evenings, singing
songs to the kids, telling stories, and eating apples. </p>

<p>Grandfather was of a retiring nature he didn't make a lot of
to-do over religion but was always ready to lend a helping hand
to those in need. He went to church regularly he would get ready
a little early and strike out and walk he would rather walk than
ride. </p>

<p>Friday was his market day he sold butter and eggs to regular
customers in Salt Lake City. For many years he would sometime
take his basket of eggs and walk into Salt Lake with them a
distance of eight or ten miles, some time on returning home he
would complain of being a little tired. This was when he was well
up in his 70's He always kept two years supply of wood on hand.
He would chop down several cottonwood trees and work them up into
stove wood in the wintertime. </p>

<p>Grandfather was hale and hearty up until two weeks of the time
of his death He passed away on 4, Apr. 1891 at the home he
purchased when he arrived in Utah in 1861. Aunt Martha and Uncle
Fred never married and lived on the old home until they passed
away. Aunt Martha lived to be 97 years old and lived on the place
more than 80 years.</p>
