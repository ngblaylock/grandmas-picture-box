}{\plain \tab Jesse Tilton, in the name of Jesus Christ and by virture of the Holy Priesthood, I lay my 
hands upon your head and seal upon thee a blessing as the Lord shall direct. Thy lineage decent 
comes from the family of Abishom, and life is held with Christ in God. Thou shalt go forth as a 
messenger of salvation and declare good tidings in distant lands. Thy mind shall expand as the 
flowers of the field under the golden sun beam. The doctrines of Christ shall spring up before 
thee as a new creation from the hands of its maker. Thou shalt be established in the truth and be 
a father in Israel. The seal of the Lord and the Holy anointing shall be upon thee if thou wilt 
harken to the voice of the Spirit. And thy light shall continue to increase, and thou shalt be able 
to expound the scriptures and so make clear the doctrines of the Church; and thou shalt not be 
confounded in argument. Therefore, study the written word, store thy mind with knowledge, 
apply thy heart to wisdom, and all shall be well with thee. Thou shalt live long and thine 
inheritance be sure. Thy family shall honor thee. Thou shalt live to see the sun in darkness and 
the moon as blood, and the earth tremble beneath the power of God, the Lord. Thy brethren shall 
listen to thy words with delight and thy counsels shall be laid in safety. Thou shalt see Zion in 
her glory, her towers glitter and the power of her enemies removed. The Jews restored to their 
former glory. And all shall be well with thy house and the angel of peace shall dwell within it. 
The spirit of prophecy shall be with thee for thou shalt know the future and thy name shall 
remain on earth and be written for thy generations after thee. And I seal thee up unto Eternal 
Lives and to thrones and dominions in the name of Jesus Christ Amen.}}
