}{\plain \tab }{\plain \i The Father spoke; a silence came over the vast concourse of spirits. While they listened 
with breathless stillness; these words echoed from group to group until they reached the 
uttermost parts of that great spirit world. The earth is now organized and ready for the temporal 
abode of man.\par
}{\plain \i \tab The sons of God shouted for joy and the morning stars sang together. Then all were busy 
in arranging themselves in groups congenial. Some through their efforts have acquired greater 
knowledge than others. Some have been more valiant in the cause of truth. Many have become 
great and noble sons of God. As all could not come to earth at once it was the privilege of those 
in authority to send from each rank those whom they desired to people the earth in its different 
periods. When my turn came to receive the message, I was informed I must wait until the eve of 
the sixth period. I may have felt a little disappointed but pleased to abide by the wish of the 
Father for I felt that he knew best.\par
}{\plain \i \tab I came into the world a descendant of Abraham, one of Gods chosen servants from the 
beginning. The Lord had proven him in the spirit world, and determined to prove him in this life 
by permitting him to come in a land of idiolatry and of parents who did not believe in God. 
Abraham arose above these conditions, obtained the priesthood and the blessings and covenants 
of the Lord to him and his posterity to the latest generation.\par
}{\plain \i \tab I have indeed been favored by being born of goodly parents and established in this land 
of freedom, a land that was given to the sons of Joseph for an everlasting inheritance. Also at a 
time when the covenants made to Abraham, and the priesthood have been restored to his 
posterity. I have been brought up in the various steps of the priesthood and have enjoyed the 
privileges and blessings it affords. Have had the privilege of bearing the message of truth to the 
world and laboring some in the temples for the redemption of some who have not had the 
privilege of receiving the covenant while in earth life. I have a knowledge that my future state 
depends upon the life I live here. It is my constant desire and prayer to live that I may meet with 
gladness my friends and associated when my mission is done here.}}
