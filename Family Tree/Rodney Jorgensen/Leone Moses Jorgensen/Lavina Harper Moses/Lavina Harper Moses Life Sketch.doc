}{\plain \tab Lavina Harper Moses was born March 3, 1879. to Charles Alfred Harper and Mary Boyes 
Harper, at Big Cottonwood, what is now known as Holiday, Utah. This was also the birthplace of 
her husband, Jesse T. Moses, and thus they were closely associated since early childhood.\par
}{\plain \tab She received her early education in Holiday where she was a good student and was 
admired and loved by her class mates for her cheerful personality. Later on as a teacher in the 
auxiliary organizations of the church, she showed skill in this work and pointed the way to 
success thru love and kindness to many. She lived as an example to follow and as a good teacher 
she would want her work to carry on. Sister Moses kept a record of the important events in her 
life which tells us o f the following: On June 15, 1892 she was sustained as assistant secretary in 
the Big Cottonwood Primary and in May 1894 she was appointed secretary. January 28, 1897 she 
was sustained secretary and treasurer of the YLMIA association and as assistant secretary in the 
Big Cottonwood Sunday School August 22, 1897.\par
}{\plain \tab From 1897 to 1902 she held positions as teacher in both the Primary and Sunday School 
organizations and was later sustained head teacher.  It was during this time she taught Brother 
Neils Anderson who is with us today. He may be better able to tell her good leadership and some 
good lifelong impressions she made upon him as a boy. Her chief objective was to make truth 
live in the mind and soul.\par
}{\plain \tab Sister Moses was set apart as second counselor in the Primary organization at Big 
Cottonwood April 25, 1901, and until November 1902 she was also a teacher in the Second 
Intermediate Department in the Sunday School for the Holiday Ward.\par
}{\plain \tab As a young girl, she showed talent in art and drama. She belonged to a dramatic club in 
Holiday and took a part in many of its outstanding performances. She enjoyed this work very 
much and was often called on to give readings at various entertainments. Influenced by a near 
relative who was an artist, Sister Moses painted several beautiful pictures. Among one, when 
finished, was a picture of grandfather Woodruff\'92s home in Vermont. Some of these paintings 
still hang in her home to be cherished by her children as a beautiful memory of their mother\'92s 
gentle touch.\par
}{\plain \tab On September 23, 1903 she was married to Jesse T. Moses in the Salt Lake Temple, 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. They lived at Big Cottonwood until 1906. It was 
here that their oldest daughter, Mary was born.  They then moved to Smithfield, Utah where they 
lived until 1914. In Smithfield, four more children were added to their happy family: Harper, 
Arabelle, Lavina, and Valate. In true pioneer fashion, she moved with her husband to 
Metropolis, Nevada, and homesteaded there. Here she was active in Relief Society work and it 
was here that two more children were born, Charles, and one daughter who died when three 
weeks old. The Moses family moved to Lost River in 1918 and attended the Arco Ward until the 
Lost River was organized a year later. Here two youngest daughters, Fern and Leone, were born. 
Sister Moses was sustained as secretary and treasurer of the Relief Society of this ward, in which 
capacity she faithfully served until the family moved to the Blackfoot area where they still 
reside.\par
}{\plain \tab She came with her family to the Riverside ward in 1932, where she continued her active, 
faithful services. She has been working as Work Director in the Relief Society for a number of 
years, always willing and faithful until her health failed a few years ago. It was in this position 
that I remember her best. I have always admired her for her sincerity in her work and her 
pleasant smile in everything she did. During the time Brother and Sister Moses have lived here, 
they have seemed very devoted to each other with a common interest in attending to their church 
work and rearing an honorable family. True to their pioneer ancestry they have performed their 
duties and, made the best of life as it came to them.\par
}{\plain \tab Lavina Harper Moses, 77, departed this life at the family home, Monday afternoon, June 
25, 1956 after a lingering illness of ten years. She is survived by her husband, and the following 
sons and daughters: Mrs Earl Durrant, Charles Moses of Blackfoot, J. Harper Moses and Mrs. 
Everett W. Jorgensen of Parma, Mrs. Wilkie Noble of Moore, Idaho and Mrs. Augustus 
Twitchell, Antimony, Utah. Three daughters have preceded her in death. She is also survived by 
35 grandchildren, 8 great grandchildren, and three brothers, Joseph B. and Edwin B. harper, 
Holiday, Utah, and William Harper of Mesquite, Nevada.\par
}{\plain \tab Now that her life\'92s work is completed, certainly there remains with all, and especially her 
family, a full measure of fond memories and an example which will bring them comfort and 
consolation. May this sustaining influence help them carry on and live their lives as she would 
have them do.\par
