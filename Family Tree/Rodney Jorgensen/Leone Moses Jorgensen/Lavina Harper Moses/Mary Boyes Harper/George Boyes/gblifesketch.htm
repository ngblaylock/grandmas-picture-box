		<P><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">George Boyes, my grandfather, was born the 28, November 
1794 or 1795, in Yorkshire, England. Though we know very little 
of his childhood, or for that matter of his life, what we do know indicates a 
youth of severe hardship. Deprived of parental love and care at the age of four 
years, when his parents, George Boyes and Ann Wilson, were both taken by fever 
only six weeks apart, he seems to have had very few of the ordinary comforts of 
life. Though it may seem incredible today, surrounded as even the poorest of us 
are by the comparative comforts of a beneficent government, the statement has 
been attributed to him that he did not know what it meant to be warm until he 
came to this country at the age of eighteen years.</SPAN></P>

1812 or possibly 1813, until 1846 we hear nothing of him. He was endowed 12 
January 1846 at Nauvoo, and 15 February 1846 his wife, Ann Geldard passed away, 
presumably in Michigan. We may well imagine that the persecution to which the Saints had been subjected contributed to her untimely 
death, she being not yet forty-eight years of age.

concerning his journey across the plains, but we have heard much concerning the
